              "  'text': 'I am writing this with great frustration. \\nElla jungle resort gave us and everyone present the worst possible experience. \\nFirst of all the location and the nature is very beautiful. I am sad to say it’s in wrong hands. On arrival the room condition was very bad. \\n1. Toilet comods not cleaned \\n2. Ant infestation everywhere \\n3. No water supply \\n4. Definitely no hot water \\n5. No AC to all the rooms \\n6. Towels wet \\n\\nAnyways we somehow managed and tried take a wash with the little water we got and go have dinner. \\nAt this point, we were super hungry following the tiring ride to the resort from the main road. \\nBut most of the items were over or almost over. Initially there was a few devilled chicken left. Once asked to restock it they brought devilled prawns and not chicken ( that also after a very long time) for a meat dish it was only the devilled prawns after that. For people with seafood allergy just eat the rice only?  because other dishes were also empty.  There was ice cream but no bowls to eat. \\nPlates, cutleries, cups were not washed properly and there is no one at the buffet to check and restock the finishing plates, cutleries and food. No one nearby area to call also. Under the plates full of oil and noodle pieces on top of the plate  as they were not washed properly. \\nWe had to go to the buffet and keep on standing until we got something to eat. When we got something to eat we had to then stand waiting for plates. \\n\\nSince we had to experience this at the start we already made a complaint through whatsapp to the one who was taking the bookings. So that they will correct themselves and the next breakfast , lunch and the next day will be treated properly for the price we paid to get the so called 3 star hotel experience as mentioned by them. \\nThe reply I got from the operator was… “NOT allowed to have bites in buffet” \\nSo, i said yea no need to have bites in buffet if we can have dinner that’s enough. \\nSo the hotel team has informed her that some people are having bites from the buffet that is why this whole problem raised.\\nShe never apologised or corrected the issue. \\nSome other person not having bites is not the solution for all the problems I mentioned above. Even if they had bites, there is a limit a person can eat and for the money they took they are responsible enough to provide us with enough food specially when we were away from the main road. \\nThe full amount was already paid to confirm the booking. \\nAs all the guests couldn’t bear the frustration they tried to talk to the two so called managers called Isuru and Ajith. \\nThey too never apologised or tried to correct themselves. They are saying that the problem is this going under the name as hotel. This should be an adventure zone it seems. If this is an adventure zone, they cannot be charging such high prices and even if this is an adventure zone they cannot keep the guests starving like how we did for the dinner. Ajith is also saying that for one day become vegetarian and enjoy. If you expect the guests to eat vegetarian for the price they paid please add more vegetarian dishes without letting them eat only rice. \\nMr. Ajith’s behaviour is definitely not suitable for a manager over there. He doesn’t know how to behave. He is always trying to rule the guests and try to be the boss like an army commander over there. May be because the owner of the place is a commander? Under the term of hotel hospitality you cannot rule the guests and talk to them in rough tone and command them over things. The isuru the other manager is saying he will send all the staff home tomorrow because the issue to this problem is the innocent ground staff. \\nFrom what I heard soon after an incident like this happens what they do is chase away the ground staff without even paying them their salary as if they are responsible for what happened. Yes the staff over there is not skilled enough for a three star resort. If you charge such amounts and advertise your business in such a way please also spend appropriately to give the best possible service, food and experience for the guests without being only profit oriented. Upon departure we had to wait for hours sleeping on the lobby until the cable car + jeep took us to the main road. They didn’t even let us stay on the room until their lorry is ready. On arrival we got a safari jeep but for departure we got a lorry. \\nThey do so much cost cutting here. \\nThey do not think about the time and value of it on guests. We had to leave with so much frustration and hunger. Soon after leaving the first thing we did was to go to the most nearest pol roti shop and eat. Where we got so tasty food and our stomaches got full. For everything I have mentioned I have evidence from screenshots, recordings and video clips. I hope they correct themselves because the nature over there is nice. \\nBut, I have also experienced similarly or even better more beautiful natural places for a lower budget and with great food and service. First of all the owner of this place should correct himself. I hope Ella Jungle Resort will soon correct themselves from cheating the guests. For everyone who is planning to go there, please think twice.',\n",

The initial impression was positive, especially with the cable car experience, but everything went downhill once we entered our room.\\n\\nUpon arrival, we found two used towels on the bed, which was quite unsettling. We requested fresh towels, but even then, there was no hot water available, making it impossible to enjoy a warm shower in the freezing cold. To add to our frustration, the room lacked basic amenities such as tissues—there was only an empty tissue box.\\n\\nThe cleanliness of the room was another major issue. The bed was covered in dirt and dead ants, forcing us to do our own housekeeping. This is simply unacceptable. To top it all off, dinner was terrible, making the entire experience even more regrettable.\\n\\nIt’s clear that the staff responsible for maintaining the property are not taking their duties seriously.

              "  'text': 'I believed in all the fancy things they boasted and posted on their Instagram and reserved this place for B&B on April 12th/13th days. In spite of the new year, they still accepted my booking at the same ongoing rate (50,000/= B&B).\\nDuring our journey we didn’t get single follow-up call from them to check whether we were safely on the way, that shows how less they care us. After reaching their Café at the bend Restaurant, we tried calling the resort contact Gayan to say that we have come, but he didn’t answer the phone ontime. So we went around the café to see if there is a security officer to inform that we have reached, but the Security Officer seated inside the café and he was deaf, his hearing was so bad and we had to speak too loud so that he would hear and understand what we say. And he wasn’t a presentable, attentive, supportive and vigilant security officer. \\nThis shows how negligent and careless they are about their security despite the fact the owner of the Resort being a retired Major in the SL ARMY. \\nWe had to wait for an hour for their Toyota Hi-lux truck to come and pick us to the resort. It was raining, and the truck’s condition was very bad, its roof was damaged and had holes. \\nAfter we reached, we were given a welcome drink, since we personally had some health concern over certain food we consume, we inquired about the ingredients of the fruit drink. The waiter didn’t know what he served us nor did he want to ask the Chef. \\nWe were escorted to our room, and we came to know there was no hot water shower. Being  located in a cool climate area. So we had to have a shower in the freezing cold water. During the whole night there were power drops, we were in the dark many times, they didn’t have a generator. \\nWe order dinner from the a la carte menu in 3hrs in advance, but the food came only around 10pm. They gave an excuse saying they were short of staff due to sinhala  new year. But why do they undertake bookings then ? if they are unable to serve food or provide service on time ? \\nWhen we woke up next morning, we realized there was no water in the tap.  We couldn’t use the toilet and we had no way of pooping or urinating.  The management didn’t know that the guests didn’t have water. We tried to call them, but their phone was switched off, so we had to come out of our room and walk all the way to the front reception area looking for a person to complain. So we disappointedly returned back to our room and walked down to the water stream near the resort (Kirindi Oya) and bathed and peed as well in the stream. Such a gross, unpleasant experience ever faced in life in my whole travel life. Then few hours later manager came and said tap is broken, no maintenance staff, they are getting water from the stream, som mud stuck in the T-joint blah blah. So we had to believe whatever he said. We were served a so called English type but very basic breakfast for the price we paid, two slices of toasted white bread, 4 tiny sausages , magarine and jam and omelet with spinach. No Coffee, No Tea, No fruit platter, No brown bread, no meat…They didn’t serve us water, but they had mineral water bottles, the glasses were full of ants. \\nWe finished our breakfast around 10am, and was going to check-out, Then we realized their cable car was not working due to some mechanical or electrical issue in the tractor engine they use to operate the cables. There was no mechanic to fix it, finally an old person called to be the Chairman of this resort came there 1hr later and he was trying all his skill to fix it. Fire sparks were coming out of the battery terminals and the engine of the cable car machine. Being a mechanic I was 100% sure it has not gone through regular maintenance of battery check-up. They didn’t even have a tool kit to diagnose the issue. While we were waiting for more than 1.5hrs, a retired major guy came tried to lame attempt to pacify us by giving a 150/= 2 FANTA bottles to pacify our frustration. But we rejected it saying we need to check-out ASAP. As were already wasted our money, time and energy which was worth more than 150rupees, and was very late for our next appointment while we were filled with anger and frustration.  \\nCable car didn’t seem to be working, we were scared even if it starts working what would happen if  it suddenly stops in the middle in the air while on travel. So we decided to carry all our heavy bags o the shoulders walked on the shaky wooden bridge with great difficulty by balancing our body with fear of our lives and crossed stream to the other side of the land. The walk wasn’t difficult to get to the top, we lost our way, and it was the most terrible unpleasant experience we faced with carrying heavy bags in our shoulders. We had no assurance that there would be a lorry waiting to take us back to the road as the Toyota Hilux what they use had gone to wellawaya town for some other work. So the resort people had to bring a lorry from outside to take us back to the road where our vehicles were parked near the ”Café at the Bend”.. \\n\\nMOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,  PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. \\nManagement isn’t paying any attention to the guests or the facilities of the resort. Management doesn’t know the problems of the guests, management doesn’t look after the maintenance..',\n",

The water was clean and the two ex-navy guides who came with us were very friendly and helpful. When I got stung by 2 wasps they were quick to clean my stings with antiseptic and provide some topical medicine. Obviously have a lot of knowledge about the jungle. \\n- Surrounded by beautiful nature, in the evenings you can sit and read a book, while listening and watching the wild peacocks, cows grazing, duck waddling and other animals. \\n- All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The young man who served us food was very polite and always trying to do his best. Also, we asked about improving the water pressure in our shower along with getting a fan for our room, and this was provided within the hour we asked. \\n- Staff helped us book our bus ticket to Colombo. \\n- Organised a bonfire for us in the evening which was very nice.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n- The room. While the room initially looks aesthetic and in pictures looks beautiful, the actual practicality of the room is lacking. The top half of the room was totally open and you couldn't lock the glass doors on the balcony. Unfortunately this led to an extremely poor night sleep. We appreciate we are in the jungle, however the fear of monkeys, bats or anything else being able to enter our room easily was disconcerting especially with all the noises you can hear in the night. In addition, theres very little security in the resort so while it might be dramatic to say, with lack of service on the mobile, it can be a bit worrying to be sleeping with a glass door open to anyone who could enter. \\n- Food was average - it was nice and personally I liked the vegetarian aspect as I eat a plant based diet. However, my partner did get a bad stomach after breakfast. \\n- Not sure what bug, but woke up with many bites on my body, not mosquito but some kind of midge. So would be nice to have a mosquito plug. \\n- No receptionist on arrival, she was only there on check-out which we felt was slightly unprofessional. \\n- Also we asked if we needed to bring water bottles to which they told us they would provide water bottles. However, on check out we were charged around Rs. 1400 including tax for the water bottles we consumed. We literally would have brought our own had we known this.  \\n- Curtains had many holes in maybe from moths or rats. \\n\\nOverall, the staff really carried our stay and without them we would have left before the night. Higher management of the actual property needs to be dealt with, i.e. renovating the rooms. In addition, not worth the money you pay. It was the same price for us to stay here as cinnamon lodge hotel in habarana which is a 5 star hotel (with facilities such as buffet, swimming pool, in room dining, bicycles etc), and this resort does not live up to that standard.\",\n",

We were seriously questioning our choice in hotel … then we got to the bottom and had to take a gondola across the forest/river and all our doubts vanished! As we got down from the gondola we were greeted by the amazing view of a rice field, with peacocks wandering around. Behind the rice field was towering trees. Our rooms were next to a bumbling stream, beautiful and so picturesque picturesque. The food we ate was all grown in the 280 acres. It’s 100% self sustainable. They grow all their rice and vegetables. They are 100% organic and make their own worm compost. As an avid Gardner I was fascinated and delighted to walk around the fields and observe all the fruit and vegetables.\\n\\nThere is no Wi-Fi in the cabins, it was the perfect opportunity to just relax and unwind. We had dinner under the stars with a roaring bonfire. This place has so much to offer. The staff was very attentive and kind. If you are a bird watcher, lots of birds to see. We saw a huge flock of the native Hornbill!',\n",

Amazing place, so much to do and see on this resort - including waterfalls to swim in, walk around the crops and meet the farmers, yoga, sit round the firepit, and more. The road is incredibly bumpy down and then there is a cable car to the resort - all very exciting and very out of the way from anything (thus making it tricky to leave easily or when you want). I spent one of my afternoons swimming in the waterfall with the Chef and then walking round the crops with him picking fresh fruit and veg to try and discuss what to have for dinner. Big shout out to the chef, Wassan, who made this experience for me. Super lovely and super funny, and his food is outstanding.

              "  'text': \"Our stay at the **Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel** in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional, and we were fortunate enough to stay here twice—once when we first landed in Colombo, and later when we had a layover before our flight the following day. Both times, the experience was truly memorable, and this hotel has now become one of our favorites.\\n\\nNestled beautifully on the bank of **Beira Lake**, the hotel’s location is perfect, offering a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the city. Surrounded by the modern skyline of high-rise buildings, including other major hotels, the view from this property is simply breathtaking. It is a stunning blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty, and the moment we arrived, we felt the luxurious yet welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\nThe check-in process was impressively smooth and high-tech, handled entirely on an iPad, which was a refreshing experience. Special thanks to the young trainee, **Mr. Dulimina**, and his manager, **Mr. John**, who went above and beyond to offer us a lake-view room. Their hospitality was top-notch, and we were thrilled with our room.\\n\\nThe room itself was spacious and pristine, offering a spectacular view of the **swimming pool**, **Beira Lake**, and the majestic **Lotus Tower**, which can be seen in all its grandeur, especially at night when it lights up in dazzling colors. The nighttime view of the Lotus Tower from our room was simply enchanting, making the entire stay feel magical.\\n\\nThe housekeeping team did a fantastic job, keeping the room spotless throughout our stay. We were especially happy with the attentive service, as we were provided with water bottles whenever we needed them, even late into the evening.\\n\\nThe **breakfast and dinner** experiences were absolutely WOW! The **Sri Lankan cuisine**—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—was superb, and the hotel’s elaborate menu of **Indian, Asian, and Italian** dishes left us spoilt for choice. Every meal was a delightful treat, and we truly enjoyed the variety and the delicious flavors.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this hotel is its **central location**. It’s close to local pubs, restaurants, and popular tourist spots like the **Dutch Museum**, which was one of our favorites to explore. Another highlight for us was the **live music** played at the bar, located right in the lobby. Sipping drinks while enjoying the tunes and overlooking the swimming pool made for the perfect relaxing evening.\\n\\nDuring our stay, we also had the pleasure of experiencing some amazing events. One memorable night was the **Saturday dance and fun event** hosted by the hotel. It’s a plush event for outside guests, but for hotel guests, entry is free—though drinks are extra. It was a great way to wind down and enjoy the lively atmosphere. As a bonus, we had the chance to meet members of the **Sri Lanka and Bangladesh women’s cricket teams**, who were staying at the hotel, and we even witnessed a beautiful **Sri Lankan wedding** taking place. These unexpected extras added so much to our experience, making it all the more memorable.\\n\\nFinally, we have to extend a big thank you to **Joshua**, **Tharushi**, and **Madhushikha** from the restaurant, who welcomed us with such warmth and smiles every time we dined there. Their kindness and service made our stay even more enjoyable.\\n\\nOverall, our experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was absolutely wonderful, and we will **definitely return** to stay here again. The hotel’s mix of luxurious comfort, superb location, and outstanding hospitality has won us over. We can't wait to come back!\",\n",

I had initially planned to celebrate my mother’s birthday in Malaysia, but when our plans changed, I immediately thought of this hotel. Despite the last-minute arrangement, I reached out, and Christina Rajaratnam from the staff went above and beyond to organize a beautiful celebration for my mother. She was incredibly helpful, and I genuinely appreciate the effort she put in to make our day unforgettable.\\n\\nThe rest of the team was also fantastic, but Christina’s dedication and willingness to go out of her way truly stood out.

              "  'text': \"Not the most buzzling city hotel in Colombo compared to the ones that some prefer in Kollupitiya with beach fronts and sky lounges. \\n\\nThis is exactly the reason to chose Jetwing Seven for your quick stay or night out for drinks in the Colombo city. \\n\\nBeing located down Ward Place Colombo Seven, the most chic and upmarket part of the city, Colombo's equivalent to Mayfair, London, or Beverlyhills California, it is patronized, even though limited in number, by a class that is equally hip (not to be confused with hippie) in style, who aren't defined by the brand of ties they wear. \\n\\nMy personal attraction of the hotel is it's aptly branded Ward 7 bar with a small but cosy balcony overlooking the city, particularly the adjoining Hospital Square from which the bar itself draws its theme. \\n\\nA particular attraction and one you MUST check out is its unique cocktail menu with signature cocktails made keeping in line with bar's theme - Ward 7.\\n\\nWhile being a little pricey one can not complain given the innovative range of cocktails they have. One that stands out from the list and one you MUST try is 'Aneasthaesia', which will privide you with a truly anaesthetizing experience.\\n\\nI think you could also have your regular cocktails like Blue Margaritas, but do not make the mistake of asking for Bloody Maries, which they do not serve, which I did, probbably to the annoyance of at least one of the two Catholic dudes (whom I thought were friends) that I last went there with. \\n\\nLater only I realized that the owners of Jetwing too were Christians and perhaps Bloody Maries are a too sensitive a drink to be served in their establishments. \\n\\nRegardless I highly recommend the place. The day I went, the ambience was a little sombre, but given the themes of the bar and the cocktail menu, and the music that complemented, I'd say it's one of the perfect places in Colombo to go chill in the evening, when the sun is setting, with a friend or two.\\n\\nCheers!\",\n",

One idea would be to use the lawn more for scheduled kids club activities as many kids prefer to be surrounded by kids their age in an environment suited for everyone.

So artificial, so wrong.\\nThe first ray of hope came after check-in when a guest relations lady accompanied us to our room.\\nHere, too, everything was prepared but there was absolutely no love, no passion for detail and the Marriott standards were not adhered to.\\nOK, maybe it's our fault, we thought, and went to the pool for a cool off and a drink.\\n\\nThere were 4 employees at the pool bar, 3 of them wearing sunglasses and 4 playing on their cell phones.\\nAs a customer, you have to make yourself known if you want something.\\nThe tables by the loungers at the pool are almost all broken. Lounger cushions are only available if you ask for them and the parasols are just lying around. A poor reflection of a Marriott hotel.\\n\\nYes, the employees may be polite but they are miles and miles away from professional customer service and hospitality.\\n\\nWe felt unwelcome from the first second as well as treated like a number and not like a paying customer.\\n\\nThis was not a place we wanted to stay for 6 days to spend our vacation. We paid for one night and then left straight after 2.5 hours.\\nAbsolutely no one was interested.\\n\\nWe personally cannot recommend this hotel at all.\",\n",

              "  'text': \"We stayed at the Marriott for a three day long weekend.  The hotel does need a little bit of refurbishment. There were little lapses in attention to detail with regards to check in and room preparation ( we had booked a triple room but it had been prepared for only two guests), however all in all the holiday was relaxing and interactions with staff were pleasant and cordial.\\n\\nThe room had an excellent ocean view and was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent and had a very good variety of Asian. Indian, Sri Lankan and western dishes.  Probably the tastiest I've had in terms of hotel buffets which are usually relatively bland in taste. \\n\\nThe highlight of the trip for me, personally was the usage of the gym, the yoga and meditation sessions conducted by Chaman. The sessions were conducted in a beach side hut with a lovely incoming breeze. Chaman conducted a very zen session which left me and my friend relaxed, rejuvenating and in a positive frame of mind. \\n\\nI will certainly return to the Marriott at least to experience Chaman's  yoga and meditation programmes.\",\n",

              "  'text': '**Avoid if You’re a Strict Vegetarian**\\n\\nI am currently staying at the Weligama Bay Marriott, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing, particularly as a vegetarian. The selection of vegetarian dishes is extremely limited, and more troubling, vegetarian and non-vegetarian items are placed together, with many guests using the same utensils for both. This raises serious concerns about cross-contamination, especially for those with strict dietary preferences. Additionally, there were no vegetarian dessert options, which was quite surprising for a hotel of this standard.\\n\\nThe pasta was mediocre, and overall, the hospitality has been lacking. Despite raising my concerns multiple times, the staff has been slow to respond, if at all. While the location is undeniably beautiful, the service does not match the 5-star standard the hotel claims—it feels more like a 3-star experience.\\n\\nAlthough the shift manager did send some desserts and assured me I could place custom orders, the issues persisted. When I requested an avocado toast at breakfast, I was told avocados were unavailable, which was surprising given that Sri Lanka is a significant avocado exporter. Later, when I inquired about a risotto for dinner, I was informed it would incur an additional charge. While I am happy to pay for special requests, I am already on a half-board plan with dinner prepaid, making the extra charge unnecessary and frustrating.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you are a strict vegetarian or have specific dietary requirements, I would strongly recommend seeking alternative accommodations. While the location is beautiful, the dining experience and overall service standards leave much to be desired.',\n",

Территория отеля нас не впечатлила, один бассейн был на ремонте, повсюду были вороны, которые мешали загорать и лежаки были грязные.Пляж был чистым, океан тоже хороший, вода теплая.\\nСервис в отеле оставляет желать лучшего: персонал плохо знает Английский, уборка в номерах не регулярна, не дают новые туалетные принадлежности, мини бар пустой и новую воду кладут тоже не регулярно. Однажды, мы вернулись с экскурсии и увидели, что уборщик убирает наш номер, чтобы ему не мешать мы вышли на балкон, а когда мы решили вернуться в номер, оказалось, что нас заперли на балконе. Мы обратились к нашему личному помощнику, но она даже не отвечала в течении трех часов, благо у нас был номер инструктора по йоге, который на спас. \\nПро экскурсии. Когда мы посмотрели отельные цены на экскурсии мы были в шоке. За одну лишь экскурсию на сафари со слонами они просили с нас 300 долларов на двоих!!! В этой связи мы решили взять экскурсии у местного агента по имени Судо. Когда мы бронировали экскурсию на Ella Bridge он сказал, что время поездки займет 2 часа, поэтому мы объединили доп локации(чайная плантация и водопад). По факту поездка в одну сторону заняла 3 часа 40 минут, второй неожиданностью было отсутствие заявленной в программе прогулки по чайной плантации. \\nА на второй экскурсии нас ожидало глубокое разочарование. Нам обещали снорклинг и кормление черепах, а по факту ни рыб, ни черепах мы не увидели.\\nЧестно говоря я бы не советовал ездить в этот отель, потому что на мой взгляд это не уровень Мариотта.',\n",

              "  'text': 'What a beautiful setting in a deep jungle. It is  only a short ride of 4x4 and cable car away from the road and yet you are world away. The chalet we stayed was amazing. It was huge and very tasteful like a decor in a movie. Our huge balcony/deck  sat  over the steam which you sleep with its soothing sound.  We were looking right at the jungle. Actually we were in jungle. All day we watched monkeys, birds, eagles and all sorts of wild life by sitting on our deck. \\n\\nBut what is more important than its magnificent setting was their staff. We have never come across such unspoiled, friendly group of people before. Despite it is a professional establishment they treated us as if we were their family. We literally exchanged hugs and numbers when leaving. The food was  local organic vegetarian and amazing. The  ingredients  picked from Ella Jungle Resort’s own  farms. The Chef Wasante  who was also our favorite guy was  not only an amazing chef but also an amazing PR guy who made our stay memorable. Our guide Abi was very knowledgeable and sweet. He gave us free jungle tours to amazing waterfalls nearby. Manager Rowan was very helpful and friendly.  Literally we have experienced true Sri Lankan hospitality there, which is priceless.\\n\\nOverall,  everyone should go there not for an amazing  jungle but also  for true Sri Lankan human experience.  We will definitely go back there  at least to see our dear  friends in the jungle.',\n",

              "  'text': \"This was my second visit to Ella Jungle resort and I was disappointed to find that the standard of the property has deteriorated.\\n\\nCOVID Guidelines\\nWe were really surprised to find that the property did not follow proper COVID safety guidelines. There were no temperature checks done, there was no hand sanitizer offered, and no social distancing maintained at the buffet. Food was served buffet-style with unmasked guests serving from the same spoons/cutlery - this made us really uncomfortable, as on one of the days the resort was operating at full capacity. The safety of guests must be prioritised in such situations. \\n\\nFood\\n\\nWhile the food wasn't terrible, it does not deserve special mention. The choices of food served were always very random. On one night we were served macaroni and cheese, accompanied with a potato curry coleslaw. The combinations of the side dishes and mains could use some thought. \\n\\nService\\nThe service at the property was fine. Although we did notice that they were severely understaffed. Suresh, the manager, was compliant with all our requests. Our waiter, Kumara, was also polite and friendly. \\n\\nEnvironmental Impact\\nWe were surprised to find that the property offered plastic water bottles in each room, which did not fit with their ethos of being 'eco-friendly'. This is something the upper management should seriously consider: either switch to glass bottles or offer filtered water for guests. It is simply not acceptable to consume so many single-use plastic bottles.\\n\\nMaintenance\\nThe wooden walkway to our cottage had loose boards and sections missing. This could potentially be a hazard, especially for small children. On our first night, there was also no running water in our bathroom. The property did offer to change our rooms, but we chose not to considering it was nearly 10pm in the night. We were informed that this issue had happened before, which makes us wonder why it was overlooked the first time?\\n\\nOverall, we feel this property has great potential. The location is beautiful, the surrounding river and waterfalls are stunning. Although there were no proper designated trails or paths, there is also potential to promote this as a destination for birdwatchers. We sighted the rare and endemic Racket-tail drongo and other unique species like the Indian Pitta and Tickell's Blue Flycatcher.\\n\\nWe sincerely hope the upper management does look into these factors. In my opinion, at the current price, the experience at Ella Jungle Resort is simply not worth it.\",\n",

What we got was fairly boring westernised food (cauliflower soup, a pasta dish, chicken in 'chicken nuggets' style. Our first stay in Sri Lanka and we had looked forward to Sri Lankan food.

However... You need to be aware that the prices quoted for drinks/meals etc are subject to Hidden taxes.. Yes 10% is normal in Sri Lanka but this hotel Charges 15%..then taxes on top... This works out at a whooping 33%...a beer will cost 1000rps..when you add the taxes it will be 1333rps...same with meals.. Very expensive by Sri Lankan prices. Nice rooftop pool area.. But management please make your hidden charges available for all to see rather than at checkout when it is too late... ',\n",

You are approached so many times .. there is a festival that ends in 20 minutes etc.  and how every street savvy you are. ( I told this guy I have no money etc ) once you are in that tuk tuk. They have you.  I got taken to a museum. Then to a cash machine where they demanded money.  I ended up giving 20 usd and just walking away telling them to ….. off.   After being dropped in the middle of nowhere I headed back to the hotel and it kept happening.  People approaching you telling you a festival was nearly over and that they must take you there.    I waved off all the rest.  And feeling quite unnerved headed back to the hotel\\nI then used the hotel  gym. Sauna.   And was very glad that I was staying  in a nice hotel.  \\nLessons …. If I went again. Prebook with get your guide a tuk tuk to take you round the sights. \\nDon’t get in a random tuk tuk without agreeing a price \\nOn needing to get to the station the following day I could either get a taxi from the hotel which was very expensive or give it a go with a random tuk tuk.

              "  'text': 'We stayed two nights in this interesting place. It is a hotel / organic farm nestled in a small valley among the thickly forested mountains of Ella. The hotel guests are taken to the hotel on their 4 x 4 vehicles along a winding and badly maintained narrow road. The road ends halfway down the mountain at a cable car station and the final part of the journey is on a cable car that deposits the guests right at the main building in the compound that serves as the cable car station and the hotel lobby. The rooms of the hotel are in chalets that are on the banks of a river that goes around the property. The farm grows all the food that is served at the hotel and the food served is totally vegetarian. They grow their own rice and most of the vegetables. The best vegetarian food that I have tasted in a long time.\\n\\nThey will take you on nature hikes in the surrounding mountains that have waterfalls. Apparently, they have a zip line as well, but we never saw it or tried it. Once you are on the property only sounds you hear are the flowing water and bird calls during the day and an amazing orchestra of sounds by frogs and other night creatures at night. Perfect place to get off the grid and relax for a few days. We were hoping to do the forest hike that takes you to a waterfall, but it was raining that day on and off, they said that it is not advisable to do it as there will be leeches after the rains.\\n\\nFew drawbacks, the internet was poor to non-existing. I suppose when you go off the grid, you don’t need social media.  The chalets (at least the one we stayed at) had unprotected ledges with steep drops.  I would be nervous to take young kids here.  Also, the elevated wood-planked pathways to some of the chalets needed repair and maintenance and need better lighting, especially during the night.  These were minor inconveniences; we had a person with mobility issues, so we were aware of them more.  \\nThe hotel also could use an internal communication system such as phones so that one could call the hotel staff in an emergency.  Fortunately, our mobile phones had strong signals and we had the numbers of hotel staff to contact them if a need arose. The hotel staff is very friendly and we had a few interesting conversations with them about various things.\\n\\nA word of caution to people who do not like insects, do not go here!  For others, who like the outdoors and like to spend a couple of days off the grid, with just bird calls and sounds of flowing water as background noise, this is a fantastic place.',\n",

The room, well can't say much other than the views were exceptional, lay out was beautiful with a partition door opening into the bathroom allowing for a bath with a view of the sea if that's your thing. Breakfast wasn't overly busy likely being due to low season but the selection was nonetheless fantastic catering for asian, western and continental tastes. A drink by the pool was quite expensive.

Most of its rooms come with a spacious balcony that offers a treat to the eye: the tranquil turquoise of the ocean, the glorious green of the palms - easily the best views of the bay.\\n\\nLOCATION: Spectacular location right in the heart of Weligama Bay - less than 3 hour's drive from Colombo\\n\\nDINE + DRINK: Multiple F & B outlets.Specially thank for Dimuthu.His service is very good. The poolside bar is your best option to enjoy the beach with a drink. The Lobby level bar also comes with great views of the bay. Breakfast served at the WELIGAMA KITCHEN restaurant is an extensive affair covering regional and international cuisine that is absolutely worth waking up for! Hands down,of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had on this island!\\n\\nROOM: We stayed in Room 819, which was an ocean-view Corner SUITE, so this review is based on that; The Room was super wired and equipped with all kinds of electronic and electrical gadgets including an excellent ESPRESS machine and easy access to USB charging and direct HDMI connections to the TV. SIZE: Huge Living Room with a massive couch and an equally big bedroom. The Suite also had a massive Balcony running across both rooms with multiple areas to lounge and chill out there; VIEW: Spectacular and sweeping views of the Ocean through huge floor-to-ceiling windows from both the living room and bedroom; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely Spa quality Toiletries by O2 brand.\\n\\nFACILITIES: Very good Fitness center with a good range of machines, weights and cardio equipment perfect for a full on workout. The swimming pool is fantastic too and comes with ocean views. They also have a nice QIAN spa and recreational area with a lot of games like Table tennis, Pool, Foosball, etc\\n\\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of.\\n\\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free high-speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Huge Plasma TV screens - one each in each of the rooms - dishing out a wide variety of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies, and entertainment in multiple languages\",\n",

              "  'text': 'Super resort located in the Weligama Bay, in the southern coast of Sri Lanka. Stayed here for 2 nights, attending a family wedding. The wedding itself was spectacular and this is an ideal resort for a beach wedding in Sri Lanka, with a beautiful garden and a roof top terrace with breathtaking views off the ocean,  ideal for a pre wedding day cocktail reception. The rooms are spacious,  sparklingly clean and well equipped with all important amenities, including a balcony with an ocean view. The breakfast buffet is amazing with an international spread of mouth watering Sri lankan, Indian and Western cuisine. The sprawling white sandy beach was clean and ideal for an early morning stroll / jog to burn off those calories after the sumptuous breakfast. You will also meet the fishermen returning in their boats,  bringing in their overnight catch. The hotel also has a well equipped Gym. The staff are very friendly, helpful and will go out of their way to oblige. I would like to give special accolade to TWO individual staff members who were exceptionally helpful and caring - Amaya Silva and Moneesha Hengadara. I stayed at this resort in 2018 with friends and am happy to say that the resort has maintained their very high standards and I hope they will continue to do so into the future!',\n",

Check-in was smooth &  complimented with the smiles of the staff at the front desk & a refreshing welcome drink. We were offered a room at a higher floor overlooking the beautiful Indian ocean, which was clean & equipped with modern tech such as automated blinds. House keeping & the room service staff  responded rapidly to our requests & they were attentive. \\nBreakfast at the Weligama Kitchen consisted of a large spread of food ranging from salads, cheeses, & Continental & Asian counters. My favourite was the dessert section which not only housed cakes & fruit dansih but also different flavours of ice cream. But the dosai & the eggs benedict I ordered were not upto the standard. The chef who prepared those lacked finesse & presentation skills. However the staff was friendly & amicable & looked into all our requests. The only negative remark is with regard to the response of the reservations team on my special request for early check-in. In addition, in room welcome amenities would have impressed me a lot. Overall it was a memorable staycation & looking forward to visit again! 🤩',\n",

              "  'text': 'In our recent travels to Sri Lanka, we stayed at the Jetwing Colombo Seven for 4 days.  Its centrally located (has a supermarket right opposite) and is ideal for short term stays for visitors to Sri Lanka. We arrived past midnight, straight from the airport, but check-in was smooth and quick. We got a superior room on the 7th floor, which was spacious and modern, with a very comfortable bed, and came with plenty of storage for luggage. It also had a large ensuite with a bath and separate shower.\\n\\nThere was a very good buffet breakfast daily. Although not as extensive as at their other properties, its Sri Lankan food section was good. For the other meals, we ordered from the a la carte menu or through room service.  The food although tasty, had some missing ingredients. I ordered a Caesar salad that had mostly coleslaw and a few thin slices of eggs & chicken sausages(?) with the dressing on the side. The biryani and fried rice meals my partner ordered were much better.  On one of the days, we decided to have high tea in their rooftop terrace area, overlooking their infinity pool/ the lotus tower. The outlook was certainly magical- as the sun set and the lights came on. However, foodwise, the high tea items were a bit disappointing, and the iced coffee that was served with it tasted like vanilla flavoured milk out of a tetra pack, with not even a hint of coffee. Despite these shortfalls, we liked the hotel and its location/ amenities well enough that we decided to make it our initial base as we arrive in Lanka, before travelling to the other parts of the country.',\n",

The hotel's rooftop infinity pool, offering stunning views of the Lotus Tower, was undoubtedly a highlight.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and welcoming, creating a warm atmosphere. The rooms were modern, spacious, and impeccably clean. The bathrooms were equally impressive in terms of size and cleanliness.\\n\\nWhile the breakfast buffet offered delicious options, the selection was somewhat limited compared to other hotels.\\n\\nUnfortunately, welcome drinks were not provided and parking proved to be a bit challenging.\\n\\nIt's important to note that advertised prices do not include taxes and service charges, which can add approximately 30-35% to the cost of food, drinks, and spa treatments.\",\n",

Im Vergleich zu den anderen Hotels der Jetwings Kette in Sri Lanka fiel hier die Begrüßung nicht so herzlich aus. Es gab keinen kleinen Begrüßungsdrink und auch kein Erfrischungstuch,dieses war bei den anderen Hotels Standard. Gar nicht schön fanden wir das unser gebuchtes Zimmer für 3 Personen nicht vorbereitet war. Es fehlte das dritte Bett und auch alle anderen Dinge wie Handtücher fehlten . Das Zimmer wurde auch erst nach erneuter Nachfrage fertiggestellt. Der Pool auf der Dachterrasse und die Bar sind wirklich sehenswert.Es war ein guter Abschluss der Reise und der Weg zum Flughafen nicht weit. \\nDie Hotels der Jetwings Kette sind wirklich empfehlenswert,das Seven könnte noch ein wenig an seiner Begrüßung arbeiten .',\n",

The Jetwing is a larger hotel than other we stayed in Sri lanka. On arrival staff were very engaging and helpful, check in was a breeze. The rooms are very large, very well appointed, clean. Fabulous shower - best we had in Sri Lanka, The bed is huge and very very comfortable. Breakfast is good. The fruit selection however is poor, probably the worst we had in Sri lanka. Over the road there is a supermarket with a fabulous fruit selection and the central market has fabulous fruit - so no excuse for the limited options. We did however ask for more and better fruit and were served a lovely platter at breakfast. Another example of staff responsiveness. Rooms are spotless and we applaud Adheeb from the housekeeping department for his fine work. Thank you!!\\nWe highly recommend this hotel',\n",

Place is full of screaming children and the pool was small and shallow and filled with children in diapers. The property is not as large as made out to be and quite shoddy. The hotel is in fact an eye sore on the otherwise lovely landscape as a rectangle concrete mass that can be seen for miles. The food was over priced and service extremely poor. Room was okay but dated and lacked amenities expected of a 5 star hotel. We stayed at the ShangriLa Colombo before and went on to the Anantara Kalutara-- now that's what you call 5 star! Suggest unless you are desperate to learn surfing or have lots of babies with you who you can cram in the same room with you, find somewhere else to go.\",\n",

              "  'text': \"I am compelled to write this review due to the appalling experience I had at Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7. This establishment has set a new low for false advertising and customer service. I booked my stay based on the promise of a room with a balcony, as clearly advertised. To my utter dismay, upon arrival, I found that there was no balcony. This outright lie was the first of many disappointments.\\n\\nWhen I raised this issue with the hotel staff, they had the audacity to blame booking.com, claiming it was an error on their part. This excuse is not only unacceptable but insulting. It is not my responsibility to deal with their advertising mistakes. The hotel had ample time—over a month, in fact—to inform me of this error, but chose not to. Their lack of communication and accountability is inexcusable.\\n\\nThe situation worsened when I realized the implications of their deceit. As a smoker, I was forced into the highly inconvenient position of having to travel from my room to the ground floor every time I wanted to smoke. The hotel's so-called solution was laughable and insulting. They suggested that they open the room window instead and then had the nerve to ask me to sign a waiver stating that opening the window was my request, absolving them of any responsibility. When I insisted they amend the waiver to truthfully reflect that this was their suggestion, not my request, they flatly refused. \\n\\nThe level of unprofessionalism and sheer lack of empathy displayed by the staff was staggering. There was not a hint of an apology or genuine attempt to rectify the situation. Instead, they were dismissive and uncooperative, leaving me to deal with the consequences of their false advertising and poor service.\\n\\nThis experience was, without a doubt, the worst I have ever had at any hotel. The deceptive practices, lack of accountability, and dreadful customer service at Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7 are beyond unacceptable. I strongly urge potential guests to steer clear of this establishment. Save yourself the frustration, inconvenience, and sheer disappointment I endured. Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7 is a prime example of how not to run a hospitality business, and their actions should serve as a warning to anyone considering a stay here.\",\n",

              "  'text': 'Hotel RIU used to be one of my favorite hotels. I had visited twice before and had great experiences each time. Given those positive stays, I decided to return for a third visit on the long weekend of September 14th. Unfortunately, this time was very different, and I was disappointed by the poor experience we had. The staff’s treatment of guests was also subpar, which I assume might have been due to the holiday crowd. However, as a 5-star hotel, they should be equipped to handle a full house, and if they cannot, they should limit their bookings. Here are some of the issues we faced that may be helpful for anyone considering a stay at this hotel:\\n\\nRoom Cleanliness - The floor was sticky, and we couldn’t walk comfortably without slippers.\\n\\nRoom Configuration - We were a 3 families of six and had reserved three full-board rooms, requesting double beds for each. Despite this clear request in our online booking, we were given rooms with twin beds. When I asked for them to be changed, the hotel declined, only agreeing to push two twin beds together only in two of the three rooms. As a result, one family ended up having to sleep on two separate beds.\\n\\nBed Quality - The beds were uncomfortable and wobbly, moving apart even when simply sitting on them. This was especially frustrating in the rooms where twin beds were pushed together.\\n\\nFood Hygiene - There were flies in the food cabinet with the evening snacks, particularly on the burgers. I mentioned this to a chef, but my concern was dismissed.\\n\\nBathroom Issues - One room’s main shower was broken, leaving only the handheld shower functional. Despite reporting this to room service three times, no one came to fix it.\\n\\nWhile I understand that the long weekend likely increased their workload, a hotel of this standard should be able to maintain quality service even during busy periods. If they cannot handle the crowd, they should consider limiting bookings. For anyone planning to stay here during a holiday, I would suggest reconsidering or making sure that expectations are adjusted for a potentially lower quality of service.',\n",

We met up with Roshan, one of our waiters from 4 years ago, still with the same happy smile.  He always took time to chat with us.  In the evenings Sajith, the bar manager, would also do the rounds, ensuring everyone was happy and having the best time.  He really does care.\\nLikewise the guys on the beach will make your stay memorable.  Some people have complained about being hassled, but these guys are just trying to make a living. \\nThey are rightly proud of their country and will tailor-make tours for you.  Just ask for Sam.  His service is first class and you won't meet a more kind and trustworthy person, added to which the price will be half what the hotel charges.  Look him up under Big Brother Tours   If you're not interested just say and they won't bother you.  Likewise the ladies on the beach are trying to make a living selling their clothes which are actually very good quality.  \\nThe people make this country, they are so friendly and hospitable.  Their economic situation is dire and they need their tourism industry to pick up, so if you're thinking of going, please do, and try and support the locals, you will be made so welcome.\\nMiss this place and its lovely people so much!

Только по пояс зайти можно, но и тут полные трусы песка будут. Но есть бассейн и туууууча лежаков. \\n2. В номере в душе вода сама меняет температуру от горячей до холодной в зависимости от активности соседей по стояку. \\n3. Фурнитура нормальная за исключением лейки душа. Она никак не фиксируется, а лежит в нижнем положении. В двух номерах где я жил такая-же история. \\n4. Минибар не мониторится и пополняется по требованию только. Но очень быстро приходят после звонка. \\n5. Сушилка для белья - на балконе. Но из-за влажности белье не сохнет там. Приходится придумывать куда вешать постиранное в номере на вешалки из шкафа. \\n6. При бронировании мы согласовали с местным менеджментом заселение в один из 2 корпусов, ближних к морю, отправили фото отеля, где обвели кружками эти корпуса, но при регистрации на ресепшен мне сказали, что мне забронировали гарден вью и что это подарок от отеля, что они селят меня в сивую в котором половина вида на балконы соседей, треть вида на бассейн и немного видно море вдалеке. Пообщаться и мне и моему менеджеру пришлось много, чтобы через 4 дня меня переселили в номер, указанный в моей броне (директ си вью). Но стоило того. Вид - сногсшибательный!!! Номер 3034!!! Рекомендую 2 и 3 этажи в этом корпусе. Этажи G и 1 - вид на деревья. \\n7. За пределами отеля на тебя набрасываются местные и без приглашения идут с тобой, забрасывая вопросами откуда ты, когда приехал и пр. Короче хотят предложить тук-тук или пешую прогулку, завести в места, где ты можешь потратить деньги или договориться об экскурсиях. Короче - за 30 метров по территории общественного пляжа я, демонстрируя незаинтересованность в разговоре, 4 раза ответил, что я из России. \\n\\nПлюсы:\\n\\n G😊. Контроль менеджмента - потрясающий!!!\\n 1. Номер большой, светлый! Все есть, кроме утюга, доски, сушилки, тапочек, набора для ухода за обувью и зонтика. Но жить без этого вполне можно. Есть элементы усталости, но не бросаются в глаза. \\n2. Кухня - блеск!!! Всегда есть все и на любой вкус!!! Шефу - мой респект!!! Чисто!!! Официанты внимательные и деликатные! Стоит поднять руку и через секунду к тебе подошли и помогли. ИДЕАЛ!!! А какая тут папайя!!!\\n3. Уборка - супер!!! Собственно из-за просьбы ее оценить я тут и пишу. 😄\\nSadeepa - имя уборщика. Парень молодец!!! Чисто, тщательно, вплоть до мелочей!!! Слоники и птички на кровати из полотенец, полотенца, подстеленные на пол, на столы в тумбочки, короче - везде где только можно. Чувствуешь заботу, не формальность и высокий уровень контроля менеджера👍!!!\\n4. Общий сервис - подкупает. Не ждут чаевые (ждут, конечно, но это не показывается). Все искренне хотят помочь. Не чувствуешь оставленности нигде, но и нет назойливости. Специально подходят с вопросами только в ресторане. На территории не докучают, но дают понять, что они ЕСТЬ если тебе что-то нужно. \\n5. Бары прекрасны. Чисто, быстро, вежливо! Крепкого алкоголя, правда, нигде нет, что в сильный минус, конечно, но в остальном выбор достоин 5 здешних звезд. \\n6. Ресепшен. Пришлось побороться с ними за номер, который я бронировал и 4 дня ждать заселения в него, но в целом культурно.',\n",

Monkeys, peacocks, squirrels, birds of all kinds.\\nThe check-in procedure was quick and smooth. The reception staff was extremely courteous and helpful in providing information on the property and the services offered, as well as on the attractions of the place.\\nThe villa where I stayed was really spacious, well furnished, equipped with every comfort and very clean.\\nThe breakfast buffet was particularly appreciated with a wide range of sweet and savory options that allows you to indulge in all types of eating styles.\\nThe restaurants were also excellent, with a great variety of foods and quality service.\\nThe property also has a beautiful swimming pool and a splendid private beach. I also had the opportunity to relax at the wellness center, which offers a variety of regenerating treatments in a relaxing environment. The service was really excellent.\\nThe Wi-Fi connection was good in all areas of the hotel, a little weak in the pool unfortunately.\\nThe staff is sensitive and attentive, careful to anticipate the needs and expectations of guests and always ready to help with any need. For example, I asked for some extra services to celebrate my husband's birthday and they were enthusiastic and well-disposed, helping me to create a splendid birthday, thanks to an impeccable, personalized and engaging service, which distinguishes every area of the structure. In this regard, a special thanks goes to Thushtika and Irosha, our very good SPA technicians who prepared a special surprise for us.\\nI also thank Mr Tharanga who made our stay simply perfect.\\nFor this reason I would highly recommend, without a doubt, the Anantara Peace Heaven to other people..\",\n",

Everything is super clean, the rooms are big and comfortable and the pool area with a view of the ocean is incredible. \\n\\nThe service provided in this hotel was one of a kind! In fact, in every department it was the best service we have ever had. Starting with our personal allocated resort host, Thisari Navoda, who has been going above and beyond with her service making our stay as relaxing, comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Every request has been fulfilled immediately, we have been given perfectly tailored recommendations on how to spend the day and much more. We couldn’t have asked for a better host. \\n\\nThe food at Anantara is a 10/10 as well. We are very picky when it comes to food and careful on where to eat and whom to trust. At this hotel we enjoyed everything and tested all 3 restaurants. The service is outstanding. Sean who manages the journey restaurant has been very accommodating and made our dinners very special by taking time to speak with us and ask for special requests. \\nI also want to mention Krishan, one of the waiters at the restaurant. He was always super friendly, made jokes with us and made us feel super welcomed and took great care of us. \\n\\nLast but not least I want to mention the outstanding service of Mr. Meuru who has been managing our stay. We extended our stay at Anantara twice since we enjoyed it so much. Mr. Meuru always made sure to offer us the best possible rate and even arranged upgrades and included dinner for us. He offered us the best service we ever had at a hotel, period. \\n\\nTo summarize, we absolutely loved our stay at Anantara and if we come back to Sri Lanka we would 100% chose this hotel as our stay. \\nBig recommendation to book this hotel!!',\n",

              "  'text': 'I booked into this hotel for a couple nights / 17-18 October in room 2214 - and left by mistake a bag containing about 20 undershirts which I’d packed for a 2 week trip through Sri Lanka. \\n\\nI am after checking all my packing absolutely 100% sure the “packing cube” I was using (from Amazon a sort of zipper bag) slipped between the bedsheets in the room. Anyways. \\n\\nAs I’m away in the jungle here I had first a friend staying in the same hotel check to find it, and then a friend living in Colombo also checking.  \\n\\nMultiple phone calls daily and multiple different players on the phone. Needless to say no luck in finding this piece of luggage and honestly it makes me question the integrity of housekeeping or honesty of hotel as - even though it represents “only” a bunch if undershirts it probably means a lot for whoever found them.  \\n\\nAnyways. Needless to say I’d avoid this hotel unless you do a super good check you didn’t leave anything behind and I of course will remove this negative flagging should the hotel own up and return what should have obviously been found - I’m still in the country this week. \\n\\nSri Lanka is a wonderful wonderful place but I was really disappointed with the lack of after service with Granbell.

              "  'text': 'For a truly unique travel experience in Sri Lanka, this stunning hotel, perched 1,600 meters high in the sky above a lush plantation, is an unforgettable destination in Nuwara Eliya. The hotel\\'s upcycled factory design blends industrial charm with captivating views and rich historical displays. However, it\\'s the incredible staff, who take great pride in their work, that truly make the stay memorable.\\n\\nNobet – Nobet, the \"stationmaster\" of the special dining car, brings a playful and whimsical touch to the entire dining experience. With a dining table designed inside a vintage train car, there’s a certain magic to the meal that I won\\'t spoil here, but let\\'s just say it feels incredibly authentic. The attention to detail and Nobet’s humor create a relaxing and delightful experience that kept us smiling throughout the evening. His interaction with guests, full of clever nods and a few surprises, made dinner a true highlight of our stay. Importantly, he truly enjoys hir role - that makes guests happy.\\n\\nNitharshan – The eight-course dinner was a culinary journey in itself, and the main dish, a perfectly cooked lobster, was a revelation. To enjoy French cuisine in such a remote mountain setting was beyond what I could have imagined before arriving here. The chef personally visited our table twice during the meal, and the next morning at the buffet, he made a point of engaging with us again. Upon learning my wife loves mangoes, he cut a rare local variety right at the table and served it to her, offering an incredibly personal and heartwarming touch that made us feel truly valued.\\n\\nJayanthi – The knowledgable tea lady guided us through a tea-picking and tasting experience that was both educational and deeply immersive. With over 20 years of experience in the tea industry, she shared her knowledge with a sense of pride and passion that left a lasting impression. Her methodical yet engaging explanations not only taught us about tea, but also instilled a deeper appreciation for it. Thanks to her, I now have insights into tea that I will carry with me for a lifetime. What value this experience left to me. From her careful guidance during the tea-picking process to the nuanced tasting session, Jayanthi\\'s expertise made the experience more than just an activity—it was an opportunity to connect with the heritage of Sri Lankan tea on a deeper level. Her professionalism and warmth were remarkable, leaving us with newfound appreciation and knowledge that will enrich every cup of tea we brew in the future.\\n\\nIn summary, this hotel offers far more than just luxurious accommodations and stunning views. It’s a place where the dedication and enthusiasm of the staff elevate your stay into a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The blend of history, charm, and personalized service makes this destination truly special. Whether you’re savoring exquisite cuisine, exploring the rich tea culture, or enjoying the delightful surprises during dinner, this is a journey that will stay with you long after you leave.',\n",

The gardens were lovely, with amazing views and had a lovely golf putting green. \\nAfternoon tea looked amazing and had we been staying another night would have loved to have tried it. \\nAll the staff were amazing so helpful and friendly, the food was lovely with plenty of choice.\\nIf you get the chance to stay at this hotel I would highly recommend it just for the wonderful experience it offers.',\n",

They had trouble locating my booking at first and was trying to figure it out and they let me sit there for 45 min without an update which isn’t ideal after traveling 24 hours. Also note that the pool and pool area is a lot smaller irl where only 10 people can fit in the pool at the same time which might cause a problem during peak season.

              "  'text': 'Firstly this probably merits 3.5 out of 5. The reason is I felt quite disappointed when we arrived, having booked directly with the hotel and asking for “Superior” rooms which bear no resemblance to the Superior ones shown on the well-known booking site. I initially thought we’d been given the  wrong rooms and had to double check with reception . We had two rooms which at $96 per night were the most expensive of our trip. We don’t normally spend a lot on hotels so this was meant to be a treat at the end of a long tour. These rooms were pretty basic, smelt quite musty as they were built in to the rock face, had many steps to reach and the sofa in one room was torn. The mosquito net had several holes in it. I understand that Sri Lanka has had a rough time recently but to charge these kind of prices, especially in the low season is not really justifiable. The hotel really needs a good returb, and I noticed that the rooms below ours were being updated during our stay. \\n\\nPlus points were the staff - absolutely amazing, helpful and polite and the food which was delicious- try the fresh fish/seafood plates. \\n\\nAlso it was really difficult to find! Put up a sign board! \\n\\nThe hotel has some way to go before it can be accurately described as a “luxury boutique hotel”. Overpriced.',\n",

У меня был прекрасный номер, я была на последнем этаже и у меня был выход на крышу, где я каждое утро лазила за манго) Очень-очень отзывчивый персонал, внимательный и максимально вежливый. У меня нет проблем с коммуникацией поэтому обо всё я с лёгкостью договаривалась. Мне и готовили так как я просила и убирал тогда и то, что нужно было мне и лечили меня на ресепшене и вообще я по нескольку часов просто разговаривала с работниками отела-каждый из них очень интересен был мне, ну и я для них тоже вызывала интерес. Когда я обожгла ногу о байк меня лечили всем персоналом) Расположение у отеля, на мой взгляд, самое удачное. Чуть вдали от центральной улицы-от этого там очень тихо и спокойно, а до самого пляжа не больше пяти минут ходьбы. До остановки автобусов тоже очень близко. В общем, я рекомендую, сама буду возвращаться именно в этот отель и буду настаивать на номере 118!)',\n",

Leaving the loud main road, you wind up briefly to a perfectly serene, quiet retreat, staffed by some of the most kind and genuinely invested human beings I’ve ever met. \\n\\nOur rooms were great, wifi worked without a problem, and there was never any power outage. \\n\\nThe kitchen is what really got me, though. I normally don’t eat much at hotels, seeking more local experiences outside. But during my three days in Unawatuna I did not once eat anywhere other than Thambapanni. The food here is nothing short of divine. Margarita pizza better than I’ve had anywhere, sautéed Tuna that redefined how fish could be prepared for me, hell even the base salad was masterfully seasoned and actually full of flavor. I actually got to know the chef, Lionel, just to thank him for his effort and the clear attentiveness and knowledge he brings to his craft.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was also very helpful. Deshan in particular was so helpful, ever attentive without being obtrusive. At one point he even offered to bike into town to get some antihistamines for my wife, who was suffering an allergic reaction at the time. \\n\\nAnd the owner, Alex, even took me and my wife on a tour of his farm! This was the other secret to why their food is so amazing—aside from Lionel’s experience and professionalism, they locally source their ingredients! Alex showed us where they grow cinnamon, coconuts, bananas, and the chickens, so full and contented. Everything about this place was clearly the product of dedication and love, from the field to your plate. \\n\\nWhen we had to leave, my wife and I actually felt sad to go. And the receptionist at the front desk, having noticed my wife photographing flowers, actually made her an adorable little flower keychain from folded ribbons. \\n\\nDelightful location, unbelievably good food, kind and genuinely invested staff, 5/5 would do it again.',\n",

Please bare in mind they are very expensive compared to others at the front of the hotel.\\nOne or 2 were constantly hassling you for the contents of your mini bar and complimentary toiletries, when I refused, she replied but they are free for you!\\n\\nThe worst thing about the hotel were some of the male guests, who persistently videoed women in the aqua class, it made me feel uncomfortable, who knows where the videos might end up, others would video women by the pool and even the children!

A polite ‘not interested’ was enough for them not to bother you again.\\nThere are also tuk tuk drivers by the hotel entrance, we used Obamah,whats app +94774618755. We even booked some of our trips from home especially the longer ones. I’m sure the other drivers are equally as good.\\n\\nAll in all you will not be disappointed.',\n",

Not many Dutch guests, but a lot of eastern Europeans/Russian guests (exept the English and German speaking guests ofcourse) The food served at the buffet, was varied, altough not always hot. But that is the problem with most buffets. The pina colada (free or virgin) in this hotel was the best I tasted in Sri Lanka and the other mocktails I tried were excellent.  I challenged my roomboy to create every day Something new with the towels and he generally  deserved his tip 😉.

Angefangen von einer sehr herzlichen Begrüßung an der Lobby und dem tollen Service und Annehmlichkeiten. Überall wurde man mit einem Lächeln begrüßt und wurde hervorragend bedient. Im Restaurant möchten wir uns ganz besonders bei Roshan bedanken der uns sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich bedient hat, sowie bei Aruna der jeden Morgen hervorragende Omelette zauberte, aber auch das ganze restliche Service Team im Hauptrestaurant war einfach sehr gut. Wir haben es auch sehr genossen das so viele Local Foods aus Sri Lanka angeboten wurden, die wir alle sehr gerne und reichlich gegessen haben. Wir waren auch zweimal im asiatischen A-La-Carte Restaurant, das wir als bestes Asia-Restaurants in den RIU Hotels einstufen würden. Es gab dort sehr leckeres Essen und natürlich auch einen sehr guten Service. Dann möchten wir auch dem hervorragendem House Keeping danken, die jeden Tag das Zimmer sehr gut geputzt haben und uns mit einem neuen Handtuchtier überrascht haben. Sie sind wirklich Meister darin!! Danke hier an Deminda der alles gut beaufsichtigt hat und sich immer erkundigt hat ob alles in Ordnung ist. Auch der Service an allen Bars war sehr gut und man bekam überall gute Drinks. Danke hier auch an den Bartender Lahiru von der Bar im Theater. An der Flamingo Bar am Pool war jeden Tag Party angesagt und das Bar-Team sorgte auch für Stimmung. Nun möchten wir uns aber auch beim sehr freundlichen und gute Animationsteam bedanken, das alle sehr gut unterhalten hat und tolle Tanzshows geboten hat. Hier möchten wir besonders Madhara, Sanera und Shaveena erwähnen das die Top Acts davon waren. Nicht zu vergessen die tollen Live Bands mit wechselnden Sängern und immer mit dem Top Gitarrist Sheril. Wir waren jeden Abend in der Lobby um ihn und seine Band zu sehen.\\nDas Hotel hat alles was man braucht hervorragendes Essen mit Show Cooking, Top Personal, Mega Pools, gute Drinks, Live-Shows, Fun Partys, Spa, Gym und saubere große Zimmer mit atemberaubendem Blick auf das Meer und die traumhaften Sonnenuntergänge.',\n",

Food at best was warm and not of the best quality. If you like pizza and chips you might be ok but make sure you get it when it is first out or they could be cold too! You would also not expect to eat off plastic plates at a 5 star restaurant - well in this one you do!! The glasses for the drinks and cutlery were also very tired and not the cleanest. \\n\\nDrinks - I only drink Decaffeinated tea and coffee so you would think a 5 star hotel would be able to accommodate that request- not this one half the people you asked didn’t even know what I was talking about and the others who did just said sorry no we don’t have any. The all inclusive drinks were of very low quality no international branded alcohol. If you wanted bottled water by the pool don’t expect to get a nice chilled bottle just a warm one from a shelf ( just what you want a hot day !!!!)\\n\\nPools - there were 3 nice pools but not a single life guard at any of them - obviously healthy and safely is not a priority! \\n\\nRoom. - spacious and clean but don’t expect any 5* luxuries.\\n\\nHospitality / Staff - vey friendly and attentive.\\n\\nAll in all a poor hotel that we will not be returning to any time soon.',\n",

              "  'text': 'We recently hosted a wedding for a German couple at Mount Lavinia Hotel, and the support from the Banquet Team was fantastic.\\n\\nThilina from the Banquet Office was incredibly helpful throughout the planning. With just two weeks to prepare, he ensured that all our requests were handled smoothly. He even added some complimentary touches that really made a difference and enhanced the overall look of the event. His attention to detail and flexibility made the whole process easier for us.\\n\\nOn the day of the wedding, Niroshan, was a huge help. He was with us the entire time, making sure everything went according to plan. Despite the heat on the beach, Niroshan was always there, assisting with whatever we needed. His support was key in helping us run the event successfully.\\n\\nThe high tea on the beach, customised by Thilina, was perfect for the occasion. The Sunday buffet was also a great addition, offering a nice variety of food that everyone enjoyed.\\n\\nThanks to the hard work of Thilina, Niroshan, and the rest of the team who was there, the wedding turned out beautifully, and our clients were very happy. We truly appreciate all the support from the staff at Mount Lavinia Hotel.',\n",

The service was lacking, and the managers in charge of the banquet hall were unprofessional and rude to guests, while the PR manager was inefficient. While we have hosted similar events at several other leading hotels, we were shocked to see how careless and uninterested they were in organizing the event. Additionally, the hotel facilities did not meet the expected standard.

              "  'text': \"Went to attend a friend's wedding. The wedding service itself was lovely, and nothing can detract from that, but the hotel treated the couple disrespectfully in my opinion. The hotel looks lovely and has history within,  the reception is spectacular,  but its all a facade. The rooms were dreadful, I say rooms, as many of us were moved or offered alternate rooms that mainly replicated the same faults. Rooms were damp/mouldy and no Air Con. The concensus was that many rooms felt like sleeping in wet beds. It took the bathroom floor nearly 2 days to dry from when we arrived.  The cleaning team were brilliant; this is about the structure of the hotel and not its staff team. The lack of investment in the hotel by THE OWNERS is telling and self-defeating. Our friend , the bride, found the rooms offered to her to prepare for the wedding, couldn't cope with the need for electricity required, so had to be relocated to prepare for the wedding. Thats a basic!! The food at the wedding was very good. But, generally, on the other evenings we stayed,  and  also at breakfast , the buffet lacked care, and many dishes were cold, as not kept at a constant temperature as the lighter underneath not kept alight. The staff were polite and helpful at all times, but it must be demoralising, managing constant complaints.  Finally, find your own taxi to the airport as the hotels one is expensive and we had to keep our driver awake as it was 4 a.m. start, and he was nodding off and erratic.\",\n",

              "  'text': 'So we stayed 4 nights at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. It looks great from the outside with the nice photos but sadly once you go inside you find a hotel that is not far from falling apart and is very much in need of investment and repair. It was attractive as the room rate was very reasonable, but it\\'s reasonable for a reason. We arrived late and found it odd that when we went to the lift on the 2nd floor, the concierge ran down to the 1st floor to get the lift. We realised later that it was because the lift buttons on the 2nd floor were broken. For 3 of the 4 nights the television in our room did not work. We had to chase reception continuously to get them to get the tv fixed. The aircon was sometimes cool and sometimes not cool. The food was pretty good and in general the hotel is relaxing for the guests however it often seems like the staff are also on holiday as it takes a long time to get service in the restaurant and most things take a long time to get done. The wifi was also pretty \"patchy\" with connections often dropping and reconnecting, which can be a bit frustrating if you\\'re trying to get anything done. If you\\'re looking for a reasonably priced relaxing place this hotel is ok if you can close an eye to a few shortcomings. The hotel is in need of upgrading but then you would expect the nightly rates would be higher.\\xa0',\n",

Food is good but could improve flavours. Restaurant and bar staff is doing a great job,  they know how to serve and up their sales decently while making sure guests are experiencing a peaceful stay. Specially Imalka and crew were doing a great job at the restaurant during breakfast. Being served by talented ,young staff with smile faces make everyone's day perfect.

              "  'text': 'Out of 5 hotel’s we stayed in throughout Sri Lanka, Heritance Hotel was my favorite hotel. It provided the best personal service! They maintained the traditional colonial type of character to it but it was upgraded. The location of it was secluded and so peaceful. My only regret was that I didn’t stay there longer! \\nThe rooms were spacious and comfortable. But for me the people working there made my stay extra special. All the staff were very honest and helpful! In particular Jayanthi (tea picking/tasting expert), Norbetraja (the server) and Shamu (the chef) made my stay from great to incredible. They all just seemed like they LOVED their jobs and they were amazing at it too. \\nAs soon as we got to the hotel we signed up the tea picking and tasting tour. Jayanthi hosted this service and was incredibly knowledgeable and explained the process well. She’s done this for several years and you could see her love and passion for the role. She was so personal and had great banter. She had this warmth which made me feel like I was home with family. Even for someone who doesn’t like tea I really the experience and Jayanthi was a big part of it!\\nNorbetraja was incredibly welcoming with his infectious smile and energy. He spent time with us to talk and had great jokes. He was happy to help whenever we needed something even if he was doing another job/role. He really went above and beyond this role! He again looked like he loved talking to others and loved his job. Felt like a personal service once again! \\nAs soon as I walked in for dinner, Shamu the chef, approached me with a big smile and gave a great welcome. He showed me the vast options of vegetarian food in the buffet which all tasted delicious. I told him that I have been loving one of the dishes while being in Sri-Lanka and would love to make it. Without asking he took the time to write up the recipe so I could make this home! I can’t thank him enough and I look forward to making this at home. Thank you to Shamu! \\nOverall I loved being here. I would have loved to have stay there longer!',\n",

The hotel is unique with a lot of nicely restored industrial heritage from its history as a tea factory. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. We had the buffet dinner in the first night and paid extra for a tasting menu on the second night. All of the meals including breakfast and an afternoon tea for lunch were superb. There are some activities which you can arrange with the hotel and we spent the day enjoying the unique location in the mountains and didn’t feel the need to venture further. The tea picking experience was really fun and unique getting dressed up in traditional clothes was part of the experience and our guide, Krishnaveni made the experience a lot of fun.\\nWe also had a nature walk in the evening with Mohanraj who took us around one of the hills near the hotel via some of the local villages. He was very knowledgeable about all of the local history and wildlife and it was something different for the end of the day.',\n",

We were treated so well on arrival!\\n\\nFood and beverages: The quality of food has been the best during our stay in Sri Lanka so far. We were celebrating an occasion so a cake was provided, turns out many folks come to the hotel for the same reason so it felt less special / unique. \\n\\nLocation: Just pure awesome. We enjoyed incredible views the entire time we stayed at the hotel. \\n\\nRooms: Rooms are dated but come with very good views. \\n\\nStaff: Hotel staff were phenomenal all around, from Muthusamy’s porter crew to kitchen, to Isai in housekeeping to flower garden, tea factory experience and so on. Majority of the staff were cordial and pleasant including the trainees.\\n\\nSpa: Given the setting of the hotel the expectations of the spa was very high (we had recently stayed at 98 acres in Ella where we had a massage overlooking a tea plantation). Unfortunately this is not the case at HTF. The spa is dated, overpriced and the setting feels like the back of an office building. Lost opportunity IMO. Would not recommend the spa to anyone. \\n\\nCheck-out: The staff were very fast and the experience was painless. Bills were explained clearly and they also provided us tea as souvenirs.

I think the salad counter needs improve .\\nThe dessert was also the same. There were different colors. The colors were too much. The artificiality of the food was very visible. It was too sweet and it would be better if the dessert was made suitable for a person with diabetes.I doubt if I got enough food for the money spent. \\nBut the staff of the restaurant is very good. I would like to express my thanks to all of them....❤️',\n",

The room was spacious and clean with a lovely terrace and view. Chocolates and Sri Lankan delicacies were in our room on arrival which was a nice touch. The food was amazing with plenty choice and different theme nights. \\nThisari was an absolute treasure who was always on hand for any queries we had and who arranged our trips. Nothing was too much trouble. She made our Anniversary so memorable and arranged for flowers and a chocolate treat to be brought to our table, together with a card in which she’d written a personal message and a hand-drawn illustration. She is a credit to your hotel along with all the staff in reception, catering, housekeeping, the ‘sunshine butlers’ around the pool and the gardening team.\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to return in the future. Highly recommend to others',\n",

From the check in to check out the guests are pampered to the absolute maximum. \\n\\nWe were welcomed with a traditional Sri Lankan custom which was a new and a warm experience. The hotel assigns a personal host who will be your contact throughout your stay. Ours was Ms. Thisari and she was so courteous and friendly. I was really impressed how much they pay attention, coz since we opted for a late checkout, the host herself contacted us informed that our key cards would cease to work by noon and new cards will be sent to the room. I’ve never come across a hotel that has done that proactively. Also I would like to mention Mr. Sean and Mr suresh from the restaurant who were very courteous throughout our stay. To be honest all the staff of the hotel were well trained to be customer centric. I would also like to thank Mr. Theekshana who’s with the security department for educating us all about the area including the water sprout place near the hotel. \\n\\nAs per the room; we were in a deluxe garden access room. It was very spacious, clean and will all the amenities one would need to have a luxury holiday. It even had a mini wine collection as well, inside the room. This being a base room category, we were so impressed.  It’s definitely a 10/10 for the room. \\n\\nThe hotel has a well equipped and more importantly well maintained gym. It also has kids+teen Centre, a spa, badminton and tennis courts, darts, billiards and even a small canoe ride within the property. \\n\\nThe kitchen staff should also be given full credit as the food was truly amazing. They have themed nights every day of the week. Both the variety and the taste should be commended. \\n\\nOverall this was one amazing experience we will cherish and will definitely be visiting again. \\n\\nThank you all at anantara peace haven tangalle for making our stay such a wonderful experience.',\n",

The beds and pillows are comfortable and soft. We enjoyed our long and most relaxing sleep ever during our trip. The balconies are huge with daybed and you can surely relax in the evening with the calming sound of sea waves. \\nThe place is fabulously beautiful with huge well manicured lawns. There are lots of beautiful animals and species around the resort. We also enjoyed their complimentary boat ride and nature walk guided by their dedicated naturalist.\\nWe love their buffet breakfast at Journeys where they serve lots of selections to choose from. They also serve fresh juices. We also tried one of their fine dining restaurants, Verala which is near the beach with amazing setting. Their Executive Chef, Chaminda, even came over to check on the quality of food.  We truly enjoyed  the freshnesh of their ingredients and softness of meat.\\nThe restaurant also played a movie nearby for other guests who want to relax with the lounge beds.\\nKudos to all hotel staff for their personal touch especially to Hotel Manager Manoj, our butler Kavindu and of course our hotel host Kavindi who made our stay and wedding Anniversary a wonderful and memorable occasion. We came as strangers but parted as friends. \\nAmong the highlights of our trip is our 2- night stay at Anantara Peace Haven. A truly magical experience to cherish a lifetime.',\n",

              "  'text': 'Отдыхали с подругой в этом отеле в ноябре 2023, буквально на днях вернулись. Пишу отзыв по свежим впечатлениям, чтобы потом в суете не забыть, а этот отель стоит отзыва. Небольшой, очень уютный. \\nПо приезду встречают приветственным напитком. Мы приехали раньше установленного времени заселения, но наш номер был уже готов и нас заселили. Так получилось, что я прилетела в день рожденья, и отель устроил сюрприз - на кровати лепестками было выложено поздравление, а вечером сотрудники подарили очень вкусный тортик, было приятно! \\nНомер на первом этаже, но мы любители вечером посидеть у бассейна, нас устраивало. Мебель немного старая, но это добавляет аутентичности, плюс ещё в обстановке присутствуют старые медные вазы, подсвечники, экзотично и атмосферно. К сантехнике при этом никаких вопросов, всё новое, всё работает. \\nИз туалетных принадлежностей: шампунь,шапочка для душа, мыло, гель для душа. \\nУборка номера ежедневно, бельё чистое, хорошее. \\nВ номере есть сейф, мини- бар. \\nЗавтраки - не самые обильные, но всё есть (шведский стол) : каша, сосиски, ланкийский завтрак (мясо в карри, чечевица), десерт, фрукты, соки, чай, кофе, омлеты, тосты. Отдельное спасибо повару за вкуснейшую овсянку на молоке! \\nВечером в ресторане можно заказать приготовление свежей рыбы, креветок. Готовят осень вкусно. \\nЕщё ужинали в разных местах на побережье, и лучше, чем в ресторане Thampabani beach house не нашли, стейк из тунца - просто огонь. Вкуснейший и нежнейший. Умеют готовить со специями на европейский вкус - без перебора, специи только подчёркивают вкус, не перебивая его. При этом обслуживание быстрое, доброжелательное. К слову, поужинали в соседнем ресторане - никакого сравнения, ни по еде, ни по уровню сервиса. \\nПерсонал отеля заслуживает отдельных слов: приветливый, пытаются помочь в любой просьбе гостей, и особо хотела бы отметить парней, наводящих чистоту - беспрестанно моют, чистят, у бассейна всё просто сверкает. \\nБассейн небольшой, но чистый и глубокий. \\nНа территории отеля много забавной живности: бурундучки, мартышки. Не нахальные макаки, а интеллигентные серые обезьянки, можно угостить их кексом с завтрака. \\nОтель явно не подойдёт любителям отдыха \"всё включено\" и любителям шумных тусовок. \\nТихий, уютный, атмосферный, очень славный. \\nОтель расположен в переулке, и это несомненый плюс: не слышно уличного шума, но до пляжа идти - пара минут. \\nКофе ходили пить в Скинни Томми, рядом с пляжем, там самый вкусный капучино и эклеры. \\nЕздили самостоятельно в форт Галле, на пляж с черепахами и на двухдневную экскурсию с гидом. Шри ланка попала в самое сердце - невероятной природой, прозрачными водопадами, сказочными видами, ласковым океаном, дружелюбием местных жителей. \\nВсем яркого отдыха и солнца. ',\n",

We had booked a standard room but were given this room without asking. It is a beautiful room at the same height as the tree tops which means there is a lot of monkey activity. There are 135 steps to get to this room but it is totally worth it as it is a beautiful room with a big veranda. I did a yoga class every morning from 8-9.30 before breakfast and also had a reiki treatment with the yoga master. \\nThe staff really make this hotel. They are all delightful.

Я и мои дети 8-4 года посетили в Шри-Ланке город Унаватуна отель Thambapanni мы получили массу хороших впечатлений. \\nВ Шри-Ланке были первый раз , отель выбрали методом тыка 🤦\\u200d♀️🤣🤣🤣 даже ни чего не изучали про этот отель - и об этом ни капельки не пожалели 👍👍👍\\nОтель в 5 минутах расположен на берегу Индийского океана и окружен великолепными пляжами и тропической зеленью. Уже по приезду нас встретили радушно и приветливый обслуживающий персонал. \\nЗа время проживания в отеле мы оценили разнообразие номеров, предлагаемых гостям. Они были просторными, удобными с хорошим дизайном. Наш номер имел выход на коридор -террасу с видом на тропический сад где живут обезьяны, барсуки и другая живность, что позволяло насладиться звуками , красотой природы в полной мере, особенно дети каждое утро выбегали на террасу понаблюдать и покормить обезьян. \\nПо питанию у нас был только завтрак, мне все нравилось , Я люблю очень острую еду , нут , фасоль, мясо курицы , овощи , разнообразие фруктов мне все понравилось , детей на завтрак кормила омлетами , йогуртом ( рекомендую попробовать очень вкусный !) хлопья с молоком , фрукты (бананы, папайя, арбуз, ананас и др) нам хватала !!!! 👍Ежедневно гостям предлагали разнообразные блюда местной и международной кухни в ресторане отеля- но это уже за свои деньги . \\nНа территории отеля имеется небольшой бассейн , всегда очень аккуратный, возле отеля все ухоженно, даже если шли дожди и были лужи персонал быстро реагировал , убирал . \\nОсобое внимание хочется обратить на вежливость и профессионализм персонала отеля, все сотрудники отеля были готовы помочь и удовлетворить любую просьбу гостей, дружелюбны и отзывчивы. Спасибо Всем на Ресепшене и отдельное спасибо Anil за всегда хорошее настроение и комфорт в отеле 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏\\nТак как отель славиться Йогой 🙌 огромное спасибо мастеру NANDAN - это человек с невероятной аурой спокойствия , с ним рядом очень гармонично , на йоге полное расслабление , но и немного сложновато 🙈😂 так же Nandan   \\nСпециалист гадания  по руке, я сама косвенно  в эзотерике и знала свои линии , но он сказал то , что ни кто мне не говорил , молодец Nandan 🙌🙏👍 желаю тебе всегда светлой дороги по жизни и крепкого здоровья , ты на том месте где должен быть🙏\\nВ целом, посещение этого отеля в Шри-Ланке было незабываемым для меня , а особенно для детей , как будто ты в джунглях 😆 я люблю небольшие отели , особенно когда к тебе обращаются Мадам 🙏😆\\nЯ рекомендую его всем путешественникам, особенно кто с детьми , до океана 5 минут ходьбы , возле отеля стоят водители на Тук туках , нам посчастливилось познакомиться, одним из них зовут Danushka оставлю его номер телефона +94 76 188 2146, он вежливый , добрый, поможет во всем , очень любит детей человек который излучает положительной энергией, очень рекомендую 🙌\\n\\nThambapanni ❤️станет отличным выбором для тех, кто хочет провести незабываемое время на прекрасном острове Шри-Ланка🌿🙏',\n",

              "  'text': \"I fell in love with the hotel from the first sight: the vibe, nature, smell, wildlife, hospitality.. everything! Our room 121 is not in the main building and I guess it's even better as there's silence. We have everything for the comfortable stay: 2 fans on the ceiling, an a/c in the corner which is great as you may not get a cold, a huge bathroom with all the necessary stuff, a tea set and a bottle of water which are refilled daily. People are hard-working, friendly, happy. They are ready to welcome you with pleasure. The chief manager at the restaurant (a handsome, hospitable man) gives the guests some extras, Lucky man brings coconuts for free (Thank you, my friend 🙏) etc. Breakfasts are awesome !!!! I still can't try all the dishes as I am quickly full. Don't hesitate, Tambapanni is a good value for money. Our friends stayed at Seaview Beach hotel that is closer to the beach and the price is nearly the same, but...the difference is enormous.\\nI am ready to give 10 out of 10, but unfortunately I have to minus 1point for the drawback named Inesh or smth like this. He is the only one who behaves as a peacock. He works at the restaurant and probably one of the managers, big size,drives a motor bike and wears a blue uniform. He is the most unpleasant spot at the place of Paradise as he is friendly only to the people who pays extra (for dinner,some smacks for example). All the other guests don't exist for Peacock he even doesn't say Hello to them. \\nThat's why Tambapanni gets 9 out of 10 from me. Hopefully, next time you will be able to get rid of him \\nWith all my love, Natalie\",\n",

The hotel offers yoga, palmistry, and some spa massages and facials, and is a lot more low key than others.  I showed up for breakfast at around 7:30, and immediately I felt I was part of the family.  My last day the chef who had worked for the United States Army made me my own bowl of curry chicken.

Now unfortunately one incident ruined it for us! We’re on our honeymoon so our days have been very early (5am wake ups) and going to sleep at 10pm as we’re packing our days out and doing lots of excursions. When we got back from dinner, we got into bed at 22:00pm and we started to hear constructions noises like LOUD hammering, drilling etc (the walls are very thin). At first we thought it couldn’t be right at this time? So we left it, 23:00pm came and it was still going so we decided to call reception and ask what’s going on as we couldn’t sleep. They told us they have a contract with next door that they can do building work until 1am!!!! I am a light sleeper but my husband can sleep through anything and even he could not. So sadly we woke up the next day completely exhausted and it ruined it for us. \\n\\nIt’s a huge shame because it was a great hotel - I would avoid staying there at the moment though if you want to sleep. To me it’s shocking they let people book the hotel when they have this construction going on in attached building because it’s not like it’s quiet or that they go until 10pm (that would be still be late but not crazy) but 1am?? Nope especially for the price you pay.',\n",

Children aged 12 and over are considered adults. \\n\\nEach room had a queen bed, was clean and spacious with good sized bathrooms, a/c and a mini bar with complimentary juice and granola bars.  One room had a small balcony with a view of the Bodhi Temple.  The a/c in the other room was not turned on prior to arrival so the room was very warm and took a couple hours to cool. The bathroom in that same room had a shower that did not drain well so the water level rose and spilled out of the walk-in shower and the window looked out onto a wall so we kept the curtains closed. \\n\\nWe were able to get same day laundry service which was helpful and the bed and breakfast rate included a buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant with western and Sri Lankan foods including things like made to order waffles, eggs, curries, milk rice, yogurt, fruits, etc..  The hotel restaurant is actually a 3 in 1 - there are 3 separate menus for the one restaurant. \\n\\nThe front desk staff, doormen and restaurant staff are very friendly.  There is a gym too. The hotel is well situated - super close to the Temple of the Tooth and Lake Kandy. You may see an elephant walking to the temple! The city is very busy and there are many locals and tourists at the temple. You can walk 10 mins to the evening cultural performance shows ( buy tickets from the venue and staff only, you will be pestered by many men trying to sell tickets to different shows ).\\n\\nI would recommend this hotel over others in the area.

              "  'text': \"I had planned this trip as part of my wife's birthday celebrations. Her great Aunt was stationed at the hotel during the 1940's as a nurse when it had been converted into a hospital. My wife had always wanted to visit and walk in her footsteps.\\n\\nThe visit was fabulous, the staff were so friendly and helpful. My wife had accidentally left her phone on the plane over to Sri Lanka and had realised when we arrived at the hotel. We spoke to a gentleman at the hotel behind the desk (Mr. Edward) He worked hard on our behalf to speak with the airline to eventually secure and return the phone to us.\\n\\nWe stayed there for five nights, the breakfast and dinner meals were delicious so we decided to only eat there at the hotel. Because of the historical ties my wife had with the building, the staff gave us a guided tour of some of the areas that were usually not accessible. This was a nice touch and we were very grateful for this. We were introduced to many of the senior staff and we were thrilled to meet the famous Head Chef Dr. T Publis Silver who started working at the hotel in 1956! He is an accomplished author and he signed two of his books for us.\\n\\nOur room had an amazing sea view, and we took advantage of this in the early evenings sipping gin and tonic and watching the waves rolling into the shore.\\nWe will definitely be making another visit. I can thoroughly recommend it. \\n\\nGo immerse yourself in the history, enjoy the food, the wine, the views and the friendliness of the people who make it their business to make sure that you have the best experience possible.\",\n",

We were a bit apprehensive about visiting after Covid but our fears were unfounded. The world renowned chef Publis still oversees all the food and catering for the hotel. And the wonderful feast that is breakfast was even better than before! \\nWe were given one of the newly refurbished ocean view rooms and the view is amazing. \\nWe prefer to stay at this particular hotel on the outskirts away from the business and pollution of central Colombo as it has its own private beach and is a sprawling hotel with its own herbal garden, museum, and secret passage (love story of Sir Thomas Maitland and Lavinia). It is steeped in history and tradition. A lot of the staff have been in service with the hotel for many years and the hotel also operates an international hotel school. \\nYes, the hotel needs some maintenance as it was hit badly during the Covid pandemic when tourism came to a standstill, and the group have hired a wonderful new CEO to take on the project of making the necessary improvements whilst maintaining the elegant colonial facade and interior.\\nFor us, the Mount Lavinia hotel is a home away from home and even after visiting from London after 5 years the staff recognised us. \\nI rate this hotel 5* for making us feel very welcomed, comfortable, and also the amazing food. \\nWe feel there is no other hotel in Colombo to match this hotel steeped in history and to be able to walk in the same steps as all the former Governors of the British Empire in Ceylon.',\n",

The other bar was closed for a conference or something, so no atmosphere to speak of.  We ended up drinking with a few others on the large verandah.  Apparently they wanted to charge $20USD for corkage for the others to drink their own wine outside (even though we weren't in the bar or restaurant),\\n\\nThis hotel has great potential, but is sadly let down by a few things. Beautiful lobby. \\n\\nI would not stay here again, I would stay in the city and seek some atmostphere.\",\n",

              "  'text': \"We are so glad to have stayed at Anantara Peace Haven in Tangalle.  While we initially booked the Anantara Kalutara, we switched to Peace Haven a few days prior to our stay.  Booking through the Anantara app allowed this flexibility.  The extra 1.5 - 2 hour drive to Tangalle was totally worth it.  Everything at the resort was top notch.  A feature that particularly stood out was that our stay was made extra special by our Personal Resort Host, Thisari Navoda, who made sure that every part of the experience was perfect.  She also managed to arrange a beautiful cake for my wife's birthday including a handwritten card with hand-drawn illustrations done personally by her.  The property location is absolutely amazing.  An overlooked feature is the yoga shala which sits on top of a cliff and has a magnificent view overlooking the ocean.  Our yoga session (through the resort's complimentary activities schedule) was one of the highlights of our stay.   Special thanks to Suresh, our Waiter at Journey's restaurant, who greeted us everyday with a beautiful smile and a very kind attitude.  We stayed in a premier garden view room which has a terrace with direct access to the garden area and is only a few meters from the lovely beach.  The beach itself is not suitable for swimming but is wonderful for dipping our toes in the water and relaxing in one of the sun loungers.\",\n",

              "  'text': \"Nicely located boutique hotel. A stones throw from the Temple of the Tooth and the beautiful lake. With a vey good dosa restaurant near by-  Balaji Dosa. Dined here every night because the attempt to have dinner at the hotel failed. Food was affordable with wonderful kind and efficient service. Thank you Balaji Dosa!\\nThe bed was very comfortable with excellent sheets and pillows. Breakfast was quite good with excellent service. Staff was always ready to assist. Wifi was excellent. And nice they had a small gym. \\nBut there were issues....  3 months and a day prior to arrival a message was sent to the hotel requesting a quiet room on a high floor. Have issues sleeping (insomnia) and sleep is necessary for my mental and physical health. This was completely ignored and the opposite was done. Instead was on the 1st floor next to the service elevator and the laundry room. So at 7am the sleep ended. There wasn't even an attempt to at least place me a few rooms away from it- instead right next door! This affected the stay and comfort. As a solo traveler I don't need the room cleaned daily. This was a 3 night stay. But on the last night did want a clean room. Housekeeping only made the bed. Poorly at that. As if a 10 year old did it. They left the bathroom completely a mess. They claimed they were busy and were going to return later. Um, ok sure... whatever you say. After coming back to the room had to wait outside until they finished their work. Made no sense. Had an electrical issue in the room with lighting. At 11:30pm maintenance was trying to get the lights to turn off. Shower also didn't drain well. That was fixed also. Felt like this is all because they assigned me the worst room and I tried to get ahead of this by sending those request previously. With dinner my first night, I sat down and after ordering, the drink came quick but the main course did not. Another table was seated after and had their meal served immediately. My order was forgotten and after 45 minutes gave up and this is when I found Balaji Dosa. Which worked out for me in the end.\\nEither way, management did their best to work it out and I'm very grateful for that. Quite professional and customer service oriented on their part. Because of this I surely recommend this hotel and would for sure stay again. Regardless of the isolated incidents. My experience will not be yours and I get this was a comedy of errors. Enjoy this hotel as it was over all a good stay.\\n\\n\",\n",

Но голодными вы точно не останитесь.Чудесные фруктовые коктейли и свежие фрукты просто компенсируют все)) Но главным преимуществом этого отеля ,на мой взгляд,является Мастер по йоге. Ходила каждый день и это не смотря на то ,что твёрдо решила выспаться на отдыхе ,а вставать по Москве приходилось в 5-30)))) Но вставала потому ,что после этих занятий был необыкновенный прилив сил ! Так же Мастер проводит целительные /очистительные сеансы Рейки. Я не знакома с этой системой ,но доверилась Мастеру. Насколько были эти сеансы полезны - время покажет. Но что то точно происходило на этих сеансах, чего объяснить пока не могу.. Если когда нибудь ещё прилечу в Шри Ланку . Опять выбиру  этот отель. Всей команде огромная благодарность !',\n",

Номер делюкс с двумя кроватями-Балдахин на кровать натянуть не возможно, короткий, спали с двумя детьми на одной кровати. Вся грязь с дохлыми муравьями сыпется на кровать с потолка. Сырость постоянная, дверь входная не закрываеться.

              "  'text': 'Set back just a stone’s throw off the main street, amongst leafy green bushes and bamboo trees, Thambapanni is a peaceful haven hidden away from the main bustle of Unawatana. It is a pleasant three minute stroll to the beach and bars, past little shops selling fruit, clothes and souvenirs. The main building is has been built seemingly into the hill and although the sun shines on the pool area, there is also plenty of blissful shade to relax in.\\n\\nWe were staying as a family of four; two adults and two children aged nine and ten. After initially being shown to a room with a double bed and one single (which would not have accommodated us), the excellent housekeeping team quickly made up another sleeping place on the sofa for my son. The room was a bit cosy, but with a large bathroom and balcony. An hour later, I asked if it would be possible to switch to a room with a balcony that overlooked the pool, as our children wanted to dip in and out of it and I wanted to be able to see them. The lovely Bhuddima (who has the patience of a saint and the smile of an angel) made this happen for us. Throughout our stay, she was extremely gracious and attentive; always smiling and couldn’t have done more to help us. We switched to a wonderful room, much larger, with one double and two single beds. Room 10, I think. The bathroom was large with an outdoor bath tub and there was a dressing room with wardrobe and drying space in between the bath room and bedroom. Plenty of toiletries and tea and coffee. Good air conditioning and a room fan. Nice wooden floor and a lovely wide balcony with table and chairs overlooking the pool below.\\n\\nAnother team member who I must mention is Anil. Again, he was always smiling, so helpful, professional and accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble. It was always a pleasure to see him.\\n\\nThe food at the hotel is extremely good. Every day they have an excellent selection of freshly caught fish, which are placed on ice, to be chosen (by you) for your dinner that evening. Red mullet, butter fish, calamari, prawns and langoustines – it is a seafood lover’s dream. The fish on the menu is either battered or grilled, which I fount be quite plain, but I only had to ask for it to be cooked ‘Sri Lankan’ style and I was presented with a beautiful mullet, pan-fried with fragrant spices and chillies – easily the best meal I had in Sri Lanka during my three-week stay. Delicious. In my opinion, you’re always better off going for the Sri Lankan option over anything ‘Western’, which almost always results in disappointment.\\n\\nOur stay there coincided with New Year and in the morning, there was feast of flavours and traditional foods awaiting us at the breakfast buffet. Buddima even suggested I wear my lungi (sarong), which I duly did. It was lovely to get involved in the festivities!\\n\\nThe pool is small but big enough to enjoy a decent swim. There is a little island in the middle that you can swim around and a few sun beds. Plenty of fresh towels whenever you need them.\\n\\nThey offer a laundry service, but there is a little old lady called Manika just next door, whose laundry service I was more than happy to pay for. She was quick and efficient and her price was per kg – well worth it.\\n\\nI treated myself to a massage. It was extremely relaxing and I’m glad I had one, although it could have been a little firmer, even thought I asked. Be sure to ask for very firm, if this is what you want!\\n\\nWould we stay at Thambapanni again? Absolutely, YES! This hotel is a hidden gem. By the end of our stay we felt we’d made friends with the whole team and I actually felt a tinge of sadness when it was time to leave. They even waved us off the morning we left! Can’t wait to come here again.\\n\\nPros\\nExcellent, friendly team of staff.\\nClose proximity to beach, yet very peaceful.\\nSuperb food – particularly the Sri Lankan options, where available.\\nRelaxed atmosphere.\\nProvided buggy service if you want to visit their sister properties, which is worth doing if you have time.\\n\\nCons\\nThe rooms smelt a little damp and mildewed. We remedied this by keeping our doors open as much as possible and burning some incense. The housekeeping staff kept everything extremely clean and tidy, but I feel the owners of the hotel would benefit from giving the rooms a deep clean and walls a fresh lick of paint. As I said, the daily cleaning and tidying was excellent, it’s just the fundamental upkeep of the room and its structure and furnishings that needs a little attention. Also washing or changing the mosquito nets, which also carried the musty smell. Perhaps a dehumidifier would also help keep the moisture out?\\n\\nHaving said all of that, this was the only drawback and we still enjoyed a wonderful time and given the choice, would have picked our room again.\\n\\nThanks to all at Thambapanni and we very much look forward to seeing you again next year.',\n",

              "  'text': 'Всем привет! 🙏Хочу написать свое мнение об отели Thambapanni. С подругой решили ехать отдыхать на Шри-Ланку, нашли этот отель. По фото он понравился , но мало было отзывов и  было сомнения, но мы решили остановиться в этом отели. Много не буду писать, напишу о главном. Встретили нас хорошо, чемоданы доставили до места, приехали утром в часов 7, минут через 30 были уже в номере. Когда вошли на территорию отеля я поняла что наш выбор был правильным) Отель понравился своим расположением, многие писали что много зелени и это так, до моря близко, кафе на каждом шагу, тук тук подьезжал к самому входу, живность разная на территории. Персонал отеля, очень добродушный , всегда доброе утро, как дела, я ушибла ногу, постоянно спрашивали(переживали). На ресепшене девушка Буддима очень отзывчивая, помогала по любому вопросу, огромное ей спасибо! Менеждер Анил, тоже очень приветливый, постоянно спрашивал как отдыхается ) В ресторане ребята и мальчик который убиралась, вы молодцы! К уборке нет вопросов, полотенце , постельное белье, меняли. Завтрак стандартный но вкусный. Заказывали еду в ресторане так как у нас были только завтраки, пицца превосходная, криветки, тунец, остались довольны. А еще мужчина, который каждое утро чистил бассеин очень улыбчивый) Команда  супер, отель превосходный!!! 😊😊😊',\n",

Реальность превзошла ожидания!Азиатский стиль, много зелени, буддистские фигуры, бассейн, территория необыкновенно красивая и ухоженная, периодически можно встретить бурундучков или маленьких варанчиков) некоторые номера расположены выше по лестнице (прилично выше), там офигенный вид, балконы и деревья кругом, атмосферно 😍\\nПереживала, что бассейн будет грязный или мелкий. Реальность: просторный бассейн, заход мелкий (можно купаться детям), с другой стороны достаточно глубокий, можно поплавать и понырять. Чистят постоянно. Наш номер (стандартный двойной) был как раз рядом с бассейном и было удобно выйти из номера и сразу нырнуть) а ещё мы периодически брали обеды в ресторане отеля (бесподобные 🤤) и нам накрывали прям рядом с бассейном, там площадка с вентилятором на потолке, это было прекрасно!\\n\\nВ номере были составлены две кровати и они были с балдахинами. Но комаров ночью не было, также были фумигаторы в номерах, но они не понадобились.\\nМуравьев не было, хотя было предупреждение, что они могут быть. Опять же, это Азия, нужно быть к этому готовыми. Один раз прибегал геккончик 😍 В номере кровати, диван, стол, стул, шкаф (вешалок добавили по нашей просьбе), СЕЙФ, сушилка, кондиционер, вентилятор на потолке, мини-холодильник, чайник, каждый день оставляли бесплатный чай, кофе и воду.\\nВ ванной: отдельно ванна (не пользовались) и душевая (горячая вода всегда была), унитаз, т��мба с раковиной, фен. Полотенца и постель меняли каждый день и каждый день делали фигуры из полотенец🥰 мы шли 'домой' заинтригованные - что же будет сегодня))\\nМы боялись, что будет шумно, тк с одной стороны бассейн, а с другой ресторан, но всё было отлично. Днём отдыхали в отеле , остальное время на пляже и путешествовали по острову (недалеко форт Галле, красивейший пляж Джангл бич, пляж для серфинга Девата, черепаховая ферма и много всего)\\nВайфай хороший, свет не отключали.\\n\\nРесторан. Завтраки шведский стол очень разнообразные. Мы брали в основном омлет с беконом (про бекон нужно говорить), сладкие тосты в яйце 🤤, местные какие-то шарики из картошки 🤤, овощи, фрукты, соки. Очень вкусно готовят! И очень заботливые! \\nПокупали свои фрукты, нам их почистили и порезали.\\n\\nПляж. Пешком 5-10 минут по красивым улочкам, первый раз возят на электрокаре, но нам не понадобилось)\\nЭто пляж другого отеля этой же сети.\\nПляжные полотенца дают каждый день чистые, свежие. На пляже персонал тоже хороший, в ресторане вкусные напитки, а обеды и ужины оооочень вкусные и красивые) сюди приходили обедать туристы из других отелей! Мы потом поняли, что у нас готовят так же вкусно и обедали у себя.\\nПобережье красивое, океан спокойный благодаря рифу, о который разбиваются большие волны. Пару раз приплывала черепашка, но буквально на пару минут.\\nХодят торговцы, но это везде, не сильно навязчивы, просто отказываешь и они идут дальше. Кстати, у женщины на пляже купила офигенный халат-кимоно за 3000рупий (750р).\\n\\nЕздили на экскурсию и выселялись из отеля рано, нам собирали ланч-боксы (вар.яйцо, вкусные сандвичи, сок, вода, не помню что ещё, но было вкусно и сытно)\\n\\nПерсонал!!! ❤️ Это просто самый важный пункт! Какие все ребята доброжелательные, улыбчивые, внимательные, заботливые! Я много путешествовала, но такое отношение встретила только здесь!\\nНа ресепшене прекрасная девушка Буддима и менеджер Анил чудесные люди! Необыкновенные! Вы это поймёте сами) помогут абсолютно во всем! Подскажут, спросят как дела, как прошел день, нужна ли помощь, что-то посоветуют. Ненавязчивые абсолютно)\\nВ ресторане Дешан тоже душка, очень приветливый, внимательный, приносил обед в номер, помогал.\\nЕщё отмечу девушку по имени Медха, она работает в офисе в Коломбо, очень помогла с бронированием, у нас были сложности, она всё помогла решить.\\nЧемоданы у нас из машины взяли и донесли до номера, когда выселялись, тоже забрали и загрузили в машину. Кстати, взяли трансфер до аэропорта нам организовала в отеле Буддима по хорошей цене. За это отдельное спасибо!\\nВесь персонал отличный! При этом, никто никогда даже не намекал на чаевые!\\nМы угощали их шоколадками и др.сладостями из России, им было приятно) не забывайте отмечать людей за их отношение, они правда очень стараются ❤️\\nПишу и реву, очень хочется обратно. Очень скучаю по уже родному Тамбапанни и не по сотрудникам отеля, а уже дорогим друзьям 😭❤️\",\n",

              "  'text': 'Доброго вечера всем отдыхающим и собравшимся отдыхать☺️\\nОчень хочется оставить отзыв об отеле Thambapanni retreat \\nБыли тут 11 дней и просто счастливы, что попали сюда.😊 Территория отеля небольшая,  очень уютная атмосфера, много зелени, чувствуешь себя как в ботаническом саду. На территории бегают бурундук, приходят обезьяны 😍Особенно в жару очень комфортно, можно прекрасно бултыхаться в бассейне, нас это очень спасло, тк сын не может находится в жару после 11 утра, а плавать хочется) Он небольшой, чистят каждое утро, вода чистая, не сильно хлорирована. В номере все очень чисто, уборка каждый день по желанию и смена белья тоже.В номере есть чайник и мини холодильник. Дают пляжные полотенца. 😌В номере фумигатор, кровать с балдахином, или как называется антикомариная сетка..)) розетки адаптера не требуют. В номере  кондер.\\nМы питались в основном в нашем кафе, все очень вкусно. Завтраки разнообразные, шведский стол. Свежая рыба, креветки, лобстеры и прочая живность привозят каждый день. До пляжа идти 5 минут максимум, поблизости много магазинчик с фруктами и сувенирами. Отдельные эмоции от работы персонала, милейшие люди!😍 Настолько искренние и дружелюбные, что прощались с ними со слезами на глазах. \\nШри Ланка теперь моя любовь! эмоции остались самые положительные, уже скучаю и хочу вернуться снова. 11 дней нам катастрофически не хватило🥺 Все люди очень доброжелательны, вежливы, ненавязчивые. 😁\\nВ общем, рассказывать можно много.. Лучше увидеть самим. Отель прям рекомендую от всей души! \\nЧудесного всем отдыха!',\n",

Breakfast on the following morning was very good too and loved all the Indian selection they had. Found out later that the chef is originally from India.\\n\\nThe issue we had was that when we checked in, the room we were given had a flooded bathroom due to water leakage from the ceiling. Also there was a leak in the main room. We were then given another room which was fine with lovely beach view.\\n\\nHowever next morning when we had a walk around the building, we saw that the hotel was in desperate need of maintenance in various areas. \\n\\nThe hotel has a private beach accessible from a different part of the hotel.

This trip in particular has stood out to us which is why we feel the need to write a review. Upon arrival you are greeted by the friendliest doormen, who couldn't make you feel any more special, from the moment we see them we know we are at home number 2! The 5 star treatment starts... a cooling juice is served and towel, which is so welcomed after many hours of travelling from London. Our room was clean with a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a selection of exotic fruit, the views from this hotel are second to none the views of the shoreline you can see from the terrace and your bedroom, we highly recommend a garden sea view room. The food was excellent from breakfast to supper, we understand that all businesses in particular hospitality businesses were effected greatly by the pandemic but we can honestly say Mount is back on track. We wanted to take a moment to say a huge thank you to the wonderful team that Mount Lavinia has a special thanks to Mr Lal the front office manager and his team (Kuven) you are spectacular nothing is ever too much trouble. Over and out for now Hotel Mount Lavinia, we will be back in no time ;)\",\n",

              "  'text': 'We planned on splitting up our trip from Sydney to Paris (on Sri Lankan Airlines) with a stay in Colombo.  Initially we were planning a couple of weeks but due to the impending presidential elections and DFAT advice we cut it down to a couple of days. We had a great experience with Jetwing hotels back in early 2019 so figured they would be a safe bet for a couple of all inclusive days with full board. We looked specifically at Jetwing Blue and Jetwing Sea - but life got in the way for a couple of days and we missed the 30 day ‘earlybird booking’ window by a day - so prices went up by 20-25 percent approx. We asked if there was any flexibility? Nope. The person at the other end of the email came up with a ‘deal’ since we were arriving at midnight and leaving at midnight with two full days in between (pay the room only rate for the first and last day - and the full board rate in between) - the deal actually cost the same as paying for 3 full nights on the Jetwing Website at the full board rate. So we did that instead to avoid any issues as to meals.\\n\\nThe absolute highlight of the stay was the full board / Breakfast Lunch and Dinner daily - great food, particularly the set menu options at lunch and dinner - really had our fill of stunning Sri Lankan food and delicious deserts - in fact the person making the daily soup options and daily dessert options should have a culinary medal - just outstanding. The breakfast buffet was fine - interesting options and eggs to order and the lovely chef made one of the juices without sugar for our second day breakfast - Sugar is pretty much everywhere unfortunately - particularly in the bread, which is a shame - we’d love to see more paratha/fresh naan/dosai etc - the local breads were outstanding but the bread basket at lunch and dinner is not worth worrying about - but then we didn’t stop in Sri Lanka to eat bread. The catering staff - front and back - are just fabulous\\n\\nThe front desk staff (which I should have expected based on the responses during the booking process) are just not particularly hospitable. Having missed out on the discount that made this stay affordable, we booked a standard room. I emailed to say I’d appreciate a bath tub. Nope. You need to book the more expensive room.  The hotel was by no means full - massive, and almost empty. I asked again when we arrived at midnight after a very rocky flight - nope. If you want a tub, come back in the morning and pay for it.  We tried to connect to wifi at the front desk at midnight. Didn’t work. Said so. They pointed to the password again. Still didn’t work. (If pointing at things made them magically work, we’d all be doing it!) We got to the standard room (which I’m sure looked snazzier when the hotel was built 52 years ago). There was a big stain on the runner at the bottom of the bed. I called down to say the wifi still didn’t work and to come and get the dirty linen. Someone came up and still didn’t get the wifi to work. Be aware as a woman in Sri Lanka, nothing is officially ‘not working’ until a bloke has taken your phone and tried to put the password in a dozen times. Just sayin’ is all. Eventually a technician came up to the room and, having put the password in multiple times, finally agreed it wasn’t working and finally accepted that the problem was not our devices and finally trotted off and reset the router/modem gizmo. FINALLY!  So at least we had wifi.  We slept, ate, swam, slept more and walked to the ocean for a look. Then walked back to swim in the pool. Day two started alarmingly when they set up a scaffold on our building, just 2 rooms down from ours and started hacking into the concrete. It looked cancerous. More hacking ensued.  Knowing that we were leaving at midnight, we really, really could not be bothered even trying to speak to the Front Desk as answers to all questions so far pretty much resulted in words to the effect of NOPE. We put earplugs in, turned the A/C to high and tried to ignore the incessant hammering and smashing. They did stop at meal times. Thoughtful. We went and discussed our displeasure with the front desk just before dinner. Ohhhhh… If only you’d said something, we would have moved you. SERIOUSLY! If only you’d visited the guests in the wing you were starting to smash apart and said, sorry about this, let us put you somewhere else for the day… Eventually, as he was away on urgent business, the General Manager who is a lovely gentleman returned to the hotel and we had a good chat.  He has been in hospitality for many, many years and understands the concept. Possibly the only person in the Jetwing Sea who does (aside from the darling chefs and wait staff team).  Anyway. It’s an old hotel and not aging at all gracefully. Sri Lanka is suffering a skill drain and it’s obviously very, very difficult to get good staff, let alone keep them. If you have low expectations, unending patience, manage to book more than 30 days out (precisely) and just want a couple of days between flights, it will do the job. Probably.',\n",

              "  'text': \"The Sevana doesn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it is spacious with lots of public seating areas and great views from the rooftop. We stayed here on two separate occasions and both times it was good. Rooms are comfortable, staff are helpful. There’s a filtered water fountain with reusable glass bottles you can take to your room. The hotel organised a car and driver for us; both the car and the driver were very good, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka. There’s not many good eating options nearby, but we did find a good little restaurant across the road which did excellent dosas. The only downside is the location, which is a bit away from the main attractions, although it’s easy to get a tuk tuk to wherever you want to go. If you choose to use the hotel's recommenced driver, you will pay more than one that you wave down, but he is very pleasant, reliable and drives comparatively carefully.\",\n",

              "  'text': 'My first impression of this hotel was that it is a bit odd because of the layout. The building has an old part and a new part, which means that you have to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the elevator, and the rooms did not have exterior facing windows. Rooms had interior ‘courtyard’ windows or no windows. We showed up without a reservation and were fortunate that they had a room available (I don’t recommend doing that). It was significantly more expensive than other places we had been staying ($54 USD compared to the $20-$40 USD range for our other hotels) and it was also much nicer. Of all the places we stayed in Sri Lanka, Sevana had the most comfortable beds with the best pillows and the best linens (they were basically Sri Lankan made Frette linen). I had the best night’s sleep here – quiet and comfy, which is striking since it is on a very busy and very noisy street right downtown. The room had a television (our first in Sri Lanka), electric kettle, toiletries, WiFi, and a small refrigerator. There was no safe, but the building is gated at night and felt extremely safe. I really liked the roof top pool, and it was bigger than I thought it would be (still small but I expected tiny). There is a shower next to the pool, which I am pretty sure no one uses to rinse off because there was a fair amount of sunscreen on the surface of the water – guests should do better. There is a seating area for smokers that also serves as a mosquito haven at night. I was not impressed with the food at the restaurant, fairly limited and not much flavor. I liked the chicken soup the best. However, their server Ruwani Piyumika was awesome. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and obviously a very hard worker. The hotel is lucky to have her. The hotel is an easy walking distance to the bus station, central market, lake, mall, and the temple. The central location also means that there are a lot of vagrants in the general area, but it did not feel unsafe. Everything in Kandy shuts down around 9 or 10 so you are in the hotel anyway. This hotel may not have the panoramic views that you get from the hotels on the hillsides, but you also can get around on your own without climbing those hills or taking a tuk tuk and that’s a good thing since traffic is bad in Kandy. Tip: if you want to rent a scooter, there are only five rental places, and you need a reservation. Totally worth it if you do.',\n",

It's on a busy road, so not exactly serene, but it's a really short walk from all of the nicest bars and restaurants in Kandy, and the Temple isn't too far either. The staff are very friendly and provided a laundry service, while the pool on the roof offers a nice chance to cool down after a day sightseeing. The air-conditioning in our room wasn't working properly however, so we had to rely on the fan so was a little stuffy at times.
